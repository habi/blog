i will install [panther](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) now.
i won't do an update of my 10.2 system to panther but try to do a squeaky-clean and fresh install.
i know that this is much more work, but in the past one-and-a-half year i own my ibook i've installed (and deleted) so [many](http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx/) [programs](http://www.aquafiles.com/) that left junk on my HD i don't want to take with me any further.
i [cloned](http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html) my whole ibook to my nifty external 80gb-firewiredisk, tried to boot from it (it worked) so i can go back anytime, so i expect no real troubles, just a time-consuming process while i install all the stuff i so heavily rely on (a small part of every junk-program i install and try out...)
so wish me luck that everything goes well (and that i don't need to call [support](http://www.arnoldseefeld.com/blog/archives/000085.html) :-)

and if everything fails, i'm just gonna [watch](http://www.eurotv.com/indexgrid.htm) [raging bull](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081398/) on [arte](http://www.arte-tv.com/cache/home/de/home.html) tonight.

**update**: three hours later i got panther on my ibook (i installed it twice, because the first time i chose install and import old settings and all the junk was still here). but the second time i chose to install a juvenile system. it shure feels a bit spiffier than before (and, oh, the eye-candy [expose](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/) is just sooo cool!!!)
