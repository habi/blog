this wednesday i went to luzern, to spend a day [reading comics](http://fumetto.ch/05) and stare onto hundreds of panels from different comic authors.
  
i went to luzern quite early, so i could visit the offices of [swissconnect](http://swissconnect.ch/) and the [velokurier luzern](http://velokurierluzern.ch/). the picture below shows the bridge going from the trainstation to the offices of sc and vkl. that silly guy just didn't want to go away.
  
what a pity.
