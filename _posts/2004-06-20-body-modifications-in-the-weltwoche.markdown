if i could be bothered to actually write a letter to the editor i would, because [that article](http://www.weltwoche.ch/artikel/?AssetID=7899&CategoryID=66) in one of the last weltwoche's is absolutely crummy!
the article is in the archive which is not freely available, so here's a copy of the printout i made:

with a wee bit of research david signer would have found out that there's no thing as a piercing world record (and the most pierced person has much [more than 500 piercings](http://www.bmezine.com/news/pubring/20030101.html)).
so dear david signer, if you don't like it for yourself, just leave all the other people living happily with their modifications happy and look that you can find your way without dissing other people!
