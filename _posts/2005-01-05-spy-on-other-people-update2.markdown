this reminds me of the old days on the internet, where one was able to [steer a model train via a remote interface](http://rr.informatik.tu-freiberg.de/index.php?con=home&sel=&lang=eng&js=1&) [1]:
  
use google to find "vunerable" security cams. if you take a look at [this google search](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=inurl%3A%22ViewerFrame%3FMode%3D%22) then you will find a huge amount of unsecured webcams, most of them might be security cameras. pretty much all of them can be controlled via your browser [2] so you're free to spy on all different kinds of things, may it be [car rentals](http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=26886), [laundromats](http://akae.aa4.netvolante.jp/ViewerFrame?Mode=Motion&Language=1), japanese [hotel lobbies](http://lobby.yumemisaki.co.jp:8080/ViewerFrame?Mode=Motion) or [bays](http://cam2.h555.net/ViewerFrame?Mode=Motion&Resolution=640x480&Quality=Motion&Interval=30&Size=STD&PresetOperation=Move&Language=0) or [a whole friggin list of things](http://aquashop-es.miemasu.net/ViewerFrame?Language=0)!



[1]: more spy-related links can be found at the bottom of [this article in the new scientist](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~goldberg/tc/newscientist.html), where i also was able to find the link for the model train...



[2]: beware OS X users: safari doesn't support the streaming jpeg technique that most of these cameras use, so you must use [firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) for those links...



[via [boingboing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/04/googling_unsecured_w.html) and [metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/38357%2523814827)]



**update: **[mathias](http://www.blog.ch/blog/) noted that the link to google is wrong. i corrected it.



**update2**: here's some more on this on [boinboing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/05/more_googleable_unse.html).
