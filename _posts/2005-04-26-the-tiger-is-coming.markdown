you might have heard it: apple is releasing tiger, their new flavour of os x. but now [mike bombich](http://www.bombich.com/) noted (in [this discussion](http://forums.bombich.com/viewtopic.php?t=5078=tiger)) that the marvellous [carbon copy cloner](http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html), a tool i use often now and then to back up my data does not work with tiger. the folks over at tuaw.com say it like so: "Consider my pre-Tiger buzz officially killed".
