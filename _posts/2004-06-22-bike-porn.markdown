i'm in the process of looking for a fixed gear hub for my polish frame
on one of my late-night surfing rounds i found these links:

- [circle a cycles](http://www.circleacycles.com/) ([pictures](http://www.circleacycles.com/gallery.asp))
- [solo velo](http://www.angelfire.com/ca6/solovelo/SoloVeloPhotos1.html)
- [chub hub](http://www.chubhub.com/pictures.php)
- [goldtec](http://www.betd.co.uk/acatalog/BETD_SHOP_Goldtec_Products_22.html)
- [harris cyclery](http://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/fixed-hubs.html)
- [paul component engineering](http://www.paulcomp.com/) (click on hubs in the navbar)

oh, and [this article from nonduality magazine](http://www.nonduality.com/900gg.htm) made me research for a fixed gear hub and not a singlespeed freewheelin one....
maybe i'll explain the difference later, but now i've gotta go to work!

ps: you want real bike porn? then [drunkencyclist](http://www.drunkcyclist.com/index1.html) is something for you
