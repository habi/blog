[they're made out of meat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-NAvPzdjj0) is a short-film adaptation of nebula award winner [terry bissons](http://www.terrybisson.com/) story about [two extraterrestrials having a funny and also a bit gross talk](http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html) in restaurant at the end of the universe (or was that another story).



the dialogue is quite funny:


<blockquote>
"They're made out of meat." "Meat?"  "Meat. They're made out of meat."
  

  
"Meat?"
  

  
"There's no doubt about it. We picked up several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, and probed them all the way through. They're completely meat."
  

  
"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars?"
  

  
"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them. The signals come from machines."
  

  
"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact."
  

  
"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made the machines."
  

  
"That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to believe in sentient meat."
</blockquote>


go and watch it on youtube. after you watched that movie, you can still watch the bekennervideo of the pendlerblog, which was showed at the swissblogawards this friday.



and if you've watched that movie, you might also want to see another funny one, the [bekennervideo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2ssGN1uTro) of the [pendlerblog](http://pendlerblog.blogspot.com/) which was shown last friday at the swiss blog awards.
