i've got 50 [gmail](http://gmail.google.com) invites left to spare.
  
this makes me think that gmail is going to be open for everyone soon, since [people](http://elbewerk.com/2005/02/xtreme-gmail.shtml) [around](http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/still-looking-for-gmail-accounts-.html) me are getting a truckload of invites. you won't get an invite if you leave a comment here (they're closed on this post), instead just head over to [isnoops gmail invite spooler](http://isnoop.net/gmailomatic.php). over there you might be able to score one of the 105589 invites left at the moment. i just submitted all my invites there...
