after i've been fooling around with an unofficial beta-version today the official beta version of [skype](http://www.skype.com/) was [released for os x](http://www.skype.com/download_osx.html). (and could not call anybody, because only bruni had it installed and he has troubles with his microphone...)
skype is an internet-telephony software from the same people that brought you [kazaa](http://www.kazaa.com/us/index.htm), the p2p filesharing software (and skype works in pretty much the same way, also through some [p2p-trickery](http://www.skype.com/skype_p2pexplained.html)).

so if you want to give me a call and listen to my voice, you can add "david.haberthuer" to your skype and test it out.
i tried it out with [b.](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/) and i must say that it works very much like intended and is absolutely hassle-free.
