[![ Wp-Content Uploads Foldschoolnicola](http://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/wp-content-uploads-foldschoolnicola-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/wp-content-uploads-foldschoolnicola.jpg)[nicola](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/nicola) finally made it!
his newest project as a [designing architect](http://www.nicolafrombern.com/) is online: the [foldschool](http://www.foldschool.com/) - cardboard furniture.

since ages he's made plans and models (filling the shopwindow in his studio), now everything is online, functional and looking good.

if you have kids [1], or are keen about cool mechatronic furniture-design this if for you!
you just need some scrap cardboard and the printed patterns from nicola, some time and probably a lot of glue. then you have uber-cool looking furniture with which the kids can play as the want. if they destroy it, you just build a new one with them. and even your conscience stays clean!

i you can't quite figure it out how it looks, he even provides you with a 3D-model of the [stool](http://www.foldschool.com/_objects/quicktime/stool.html), [chair](http://www.foldschool.com/_objects/quicktime/chair.html) and [rocker](http://www.foldschool.com/_objects/quicktime/rocker.html).

and yes, he's [all over the web](http://technorati.com/search/foldschool) already and even got [BBed](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/03/21/fold_your_own_kids_f.html)!
congratulations nicola!
