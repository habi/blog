today is the free-for-all friday! (from now on until sometimes late tomorrow night)
free for all means you can post whatever you want on my blog.
say what you want to say, share a link, complain about my blogging habits, etc...
all you have to do is login and post!

here's how to do it:

go to [http://habi.gna.ch/blog/mt.cgi](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/mt.cgi)
login as user "**guest**" with the password "**march04**"
click on "New Entry" on the left.
enter a descriptive title for your post and change the "Post Status" from "Draft" to "Publish" or else nobody will see your entry.
then type what you want to type in "Entry Body".
when you're done, click "Save" and your entry will be on the site.

rules:
sign your post with your name and (if you have) your website, or else i cannot find out who you are!
please keep it somewhat clean...if you don't think I would post it, don't. spam is not acceptable and will be deleted asap and porn links will be checked out by me and then deleted :-)
i reserve the right to edit/delete inappropriate posts (or those with really obvious spelling mistakes)
and most important: have fun!
