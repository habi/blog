thomas allenbach from [the bund](http://www.bund.ch/) wrote a pretty good [review](http://www.bund.ch/artikel_26352.html) of the upcoming movie [spiderman 2](http://imdb.com/title/tt0316654/) (although he managed to call peter parker - who is spiderman - peter barker at least six times and no-one noticed...).
the fueled my desire to go and see the movie, because i always dug spiderman comics and think [sam raimi](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000600/) has a good hand with fiction-films.

to relieve some pain of waiting, you can watch the [trailer](http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/spider-man_2/), that apple provides on their [trailer-page](http://www.apple.com/trailers/).
but better (and a lot funnier) is to watch the movie [spiderman: the peril of doc ock](http://playlist.yahoo.com/makeplaylist.dll?id=1277883&sdm=web&qtw=640&qth=400) from [spite your face productions](http://spiteyourface.com/) which is as hilarious as it is brilliant, because it's a full-featured, albeit short movie done fully as a stop-motion lego animation!
amazing!
