i don't have a story like [iron man and me](http://adactio.com/journal/1530/), but a nice one to tell anyways:

about four months ago a miss gÃ´mez castro contacted me through flickr about the photo of [our guide steffen](https://flickr.com/photos/habi/2549946/) i shot about four years ago with an ultracheap disposable underwater camera in sharm el sheikh.

she wrote me that she came across my photo and she:


> ... found it very interesting and we would like to use it for educational purposes in a book.
> We're currently editing for the publishing company Santillana Group in Argentina.
> This photo would be appropriate as supporting graphical material for an interior page dealing with related subject matter.
> It would be included in a book for elementary school, to be used in public and private schools.

i quickly agreed that she can use the image with proper attribution and now, after some emailing back and forth, she has sent me the final page from the book.
and i have to say that i'm quite pleased with the result, but judge for yourself: here's a screenshot of the page of the book:

[![book.jpg](https://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/book2.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/book1.jpg)

if you're really interested, you can also download a copy of [the page as a pdf](https://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/book.pdf), but it's a hefty 4 MB and you don't see much more than on the screenshot.

not too bad, innit?

i'll add this to the nice stories that creative commons has brought to me already: [another diving story](https://habi.gna.ch/2004/09/09/how-nice/), even [another one](http://goseasia.about.com/od/travelplanning/ss/8seasiasights_3.htm), one about [police and demonstrators](https://habi.gna.ch/2006/04/03/nowpubliccom-uses-my-photos-with-my-permission/) , one about [downtown fires](https://habi.gna.ch/2006/03/07/creative-commons-in-full-effect/) and one about [screensavers](https://habi.gna.ch/2007/02/08/nokia/).
