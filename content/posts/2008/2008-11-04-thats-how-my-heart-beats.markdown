whoever follows me on [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/notice/878390) (or on facebook for that matter) knows that i've spent a noon lying in a tight and noisy tube. at the inselspital they're always looking for gunia pigs for [mri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI)-studies, and i've been there (for the [second time](https://flickr.com/photos/habi/2071160155/) now). the reward you get afterwards is a dvd with the images of your bodypart they imaged, the last time it was my head, now - since they're working on spectroscopy of the heart muscle - i got images of my beating heart and my torso.

and since there is a wonderful free [dicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicom)-viewer for the apple platform, [osirix](http://www.osirix-viewer.com/), i've tried to make some nice videos of my inner workings. so without much further ado, here's the videos:

my beating heart, axial view:

</center>

my beating heart, sagittal view:

</center>

a little fly-around of my torso:

<center>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/3003882516" title="my torso - rotating"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3184/3003882516_47eea6e619.jpg" alt="my torso - rotating" width="500" height="500"></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>

all the images have been made with double triggering, once a trigger for breathing, to compensate for the motion of the internal organs, and on top of that with a trigger on the heart-beats, to actally be able to image a full beating sequence of my heart. the funny thing is, that the people that performed the study had to ask me to breathe a bit faster, since one imaging cycle took them so long :)


oh, and BTW: here's [one video and one view of my head](https://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/head/). whoever tells my the reason that a piece on the back of my skull is missing wins a price.
