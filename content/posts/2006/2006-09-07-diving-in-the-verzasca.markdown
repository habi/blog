as mentioned before i've been diving in the verzasca this weekend. now i'm uploading all the images to flickr. you can see the images in [this set here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/sets/72157594267217032/).
  
the two videos below are videos i shot and uploaded to youtube, the first one shows Ã¤ndu blowing some bubbles. while shooting the second one i nearly peed in my divesuit 'cause the thing that swam through scared me quite a bit, but see for yourself...
