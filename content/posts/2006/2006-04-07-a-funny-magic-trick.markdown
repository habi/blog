i got a chuckle out of this, 'cause it really works. makes a neat office-trick:


<blockquote>
Allright here's what I want you to do -  while sitting at your desk, lift your right foot off the floor and make clockwise circles.
  
Now, while doing this, draw the number "6" in the air with your right hand.
  
Your foot will change direction and there's nothing you can do about it!
</blockquote>
