google revamped their [video service](http://video.google.com/). you can now buy a big selection of videos. but the more important thing (for me, personally...) is, that you can download pretty much every video, readily formatted for your psp/ipod/big box on the floor.
  
now i really need tho fork out those 15 bucks for [pspware](http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/pspware), so i don't get that nag-screen when synching my movies over to my new gadget.
  
oh, and google earth is now officially out of beta and [available for the mac](http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html), too.
  
there goes my afternoon....
