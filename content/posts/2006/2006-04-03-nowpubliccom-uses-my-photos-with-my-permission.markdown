[![Nowpublic](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/nowpublic-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/nowpublic.jpg)[my pictures from saturday evening](https://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/sets/72057594097067744/) are now part of a story at nowpublic.com.



how does that happen you ask?



this afternoon i got an email from [clorenz41](https://flickr.com/people/clorenz/) [1] through flickr. he asked if he could use my photos "for a few stories that have been sent in". the mail included some fancy link which made the whole process work automagically.
  
so after some clicks my pictures are now part of a story from [conneticutkati](http://www.nowpublic.com/user/5253) [2], where she quotes another article on indymedia.ch.
  
if you want to read the post at nowpublic, then click [here](http://www.nowpublic.com/node/39907) or take a look at the screenshot on the left.



if this is happening [more often](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000738.html), maybe i should start to take money for my images?



[1] he is: "Director, Contributor Relations, NowPublic."
  
[2] i wonder why she writes about the antifa abendspaziergang, although she's from vancouver...
