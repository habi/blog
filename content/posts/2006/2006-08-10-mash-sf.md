and here's another one of those short blurbs (i'm a bit in a hurry):
  
if you don't dare to look at road-rashes, cannot stand snotty music and have not the tiniest bit of love for messengers in your heart, then do NOT go and see the preview clips of the upcoming movie [MASHSF](http://www.mashsf.com/).



but if you ride a fixie, are a messenger or something like that (tip to the hat to [lausanne](http://velocite.ch/weblogtoo/)), the DO it!



oh, and btw, i had some problems playing the first clip with quicktime, but luckily, its mirrored over at [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaxAEXBBKfY).
