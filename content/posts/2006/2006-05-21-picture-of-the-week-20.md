'cause ninas knee is [still hurting like a bitch](http://en-en.finisherclip.de/index.php?startnr=18248&event=bern_06), we didn't go to the [seilpark](http://seilpark.ch/) today, instead watched the latest episode of [lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/) and went to have a coffe on the [gurten](http://www.gurtenpark.ch/gurten).
  
i shot the image below between some shots for a panorama from the look-out tower. nina looks a bit held tight, but nonetheless i like the picture. as soon as i finish the panoramas i'll post them too.
