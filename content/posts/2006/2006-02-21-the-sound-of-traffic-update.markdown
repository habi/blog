[![Soundoftraffic](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/soundoftraffic-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/soundoftraffic.jpg)it's been quite a long time since i've posted something about new software additions to my mac. [this app](http://www.smokinggun.com/projects/soundoftraffic/) here is actually completely useless, but nonetheless it's been running since half an hour.
  
sound of traffic is a tiny java application (112 kb) that converts your network traffic into midi notes. my traffic sounds like a laid back chill-out track (i'm downloading/seeding the latest episode of [the it crowd](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000734.html) over bittorrent and updating some feeds from time to time). the app needs your admin password to access some devices and only works on OS X and Unix [1].



[Ã¤ndu](http://filewile.com/), couldn't you use this for your next song?



a funny little time-waster!

**update:** jan used sound of traffic in one of his cool [pieceocasts](https://pieceoplastic.com/index.php/2217/pieceocast-friday-044/)
