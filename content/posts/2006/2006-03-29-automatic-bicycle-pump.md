[![Parasiticpump](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/parasiticpump-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/parasiticpump.jpg)over at the makezine phil torrone links to a "[device](http://www.instructables.com/ex/i/D26152900EB11029BC4A001143E7E506/?ALLSTEPS)" which solves the hassle of pumping up a flat tire through a parasitic device.

would be perfect for work, but i guess you'd have even more angry car-drivers around, since it uses "_conveniently available pressurized air stored in automobiles."_
