as mentioned [before](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000782.html), i also shot two panoramas from the watch-tower yesterday. because i'm on holiday preparation, i found some time to stitch them with the excellent [hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/) [1].
  
both panoramas below were shot hand-held, without a tripod and without aperture-control (i need that with my next camera...). the original images were resized to 1024*768 pixels to prevent harddisk-bloat, and then stitched.
  
with the free program [make cubic](http://developer.apple.com/quicktime/quicktimeintro/tools/) they were assembled into a QTVR. click on the thumbnails below, wait until the movies are loaded (beware: they're both quite big!) and then click/drag around with your mouse.



here's the one i shot from the center of the tower:
  
[![Gurten Turm Zentrum](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/gurten_turm_zentrum-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/gurten_turm_zentrum.mov) (1.7mb .mov)
  
this image was quite tricky to assemble, mostly because of the distortion of the wooden beams in contrast to the not distorted heaven. maybe i should start carrying a tripod around...  




and here's the one i shot from the handrail:
  
[![Gurten Aussen-1](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/gurten_aussen-1-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/gurten_aussen-1.mov)(1.8mb .mov)
  
this image was assembled fully automatic using [autopano-sift](http://user.cs.tu-berlin.de/~nowozin/autopano-sift/), hugin and makecubic. no intervention from me except clicking some buttons and dragging a file to the dock. nifty, innit?  




if you'd like to see the pictures as jpg, then you can see them on [flickr](https://flickr.com/search/?w=all&q=gurten+tower+panorama&m=text). both images are available in full glory, be it either [7153 x 681](https://static.flickr.com/46/151183243_e6ef0a69eb_o.jpg) (from the center) or [7040 x 694](https://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=151184356&size=o) (from the handrail) pixels big.



[1] if you load the page, you might see some panoramas from me as the head banner....
