since it's so easy to install plugins in wordpress (upload, activate, finished), i've installed some more plugins here:

first: [dropdown-archives](http://reidab.com/2006/10/dropdown-archives-widget/). they unclutter my sidebar without a single line of coding. it compacts the full archives into a nice dropdown-field. i feel like noone uses the archives, but still felt like letting them stay in the sidebar.

the second one is more for safari users (because it [degrades nicely for other browsers](http://www.bartelme.at/journal/archive/safaris_search_field/)): the [safari-search-field widget](http://reidab.com/2006/10/safari-search-field-widget/). it adds a search field to the blog that looks and behaves like the one safari-users have in their top-left corner (unless you installed [inquisitor 3](http://www.inquisitorx.com/safari/)). if you use another browser it looks like a normal search field, as you can see below.

[![Search.Safari-1](https://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/images/search.safari-1-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/images/search.safari-1.jpg)   [![Search.Firefox-1](https://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/images/search.firefox-1-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/images/search.firefox-1.jpg)
  
[both via [wordpress widgets](http://widgets.wordpress.com)]

oh, and as you can see in the top-left corner: [ich bin nicht elit√§r](http://www.p4x.ch/elitaer/nicht_elitaer.htm) :-)
