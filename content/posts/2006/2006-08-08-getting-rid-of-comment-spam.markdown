just a quick note to all the [MT](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/)-users under my readers: since i've implemented [this anti-spam measure](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000802.html) a month ago, i've gotten TWO single comment spams. i didn't even bother analyzing them carefully, wether they've been submitted by a robot or a human.



i must say it's quite a relief, going from five comment-spams per minute to two spam-comments per month.
  
and since i haven't heard from chris - the server admin - i guess the load on the server must have gone down a bit, too.



so, if you got a problem with comment spam, then install [this plugin](http://alogblog.com/movabletype/plugins/ccode_and_tcode_for_blocking_commenttrackback_spam_for_mt_32/) here, it really helps!
