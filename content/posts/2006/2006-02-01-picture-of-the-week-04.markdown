the past saturday we wanted to go skiing. when we arrived in [adelboden](http://www.adelboden-lenk.ch/) at 20 past 9 in the morning we were informed that the whole ski-region is closed because of the [guggifohn](https://google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=guggif%C3%B6hn&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=iw) (a wind with velocities up to [246 km/h](http://www.st.gallen.ch/news/detail.asp?ID=168655)). we then waited for more informations, but around 10:30 it was evident that the chairlifts and cablecars won't open for the day.
  
we then decided to switch to the [engstligenalp](http://engstligenalp.ch/), but it turned out that the fohn was blowing there, too.
  
before we drove to [grindelwald](http://www.grindelwald.com/) we first called them, and indeed, they were closed, too. so after a short debate we decided to do something really silly, namely drive from frutigen to le bouveret into the [aquaparc](http://www.aquaparc.ch/), without changing any clothes and leaving ski equipement for five persons in the car.
  
this explains why pesche stands in front of those toboggans with his snowboard clothes:

in the end it was also rather funny, but a skiing day would have been more welcome.
