i just cannot seem to stop it!
  
my blog is sometimes so majorly hit by spam comments, that chris sent me an email saying that i strain the server too much (technospeak: "ca. load 20").
  
even [renaming the relevant files](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000761.html) did not help, so it had to take more drastic measures. [1]



i've installed a [plugin for MT3.2](http://alogblog.com/movabletype/plugins/ccode_and_tcode_for_blocking_commenttrackback_spam_for_mt_32/) which tries adds a hidden input field and then obfuscates the code through some javascript trickery.
  
because that works before the spam comments get submitted to the system this should lessen the strain on the server a bit (i hope!).



and since i can leave comments, everything seems to work fine, so i'll just have to wait if it really works with the server load...



[1] if that's not gonna help now i need to start doing something with [captchas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha), but i really detest them!
