yesterday we've been to the [zoo](http://www.zoo.ch/) in zurich, mostly to see the [masaola](http://www.zoo.ch/Masoala.967.0.html)-hall (which was really impressive).
  
during our stroll through the zoo we passed at the enclosure of the otters where i snapped an image of this little fellow passing out in his bed (which is what i'm gonna do now).
