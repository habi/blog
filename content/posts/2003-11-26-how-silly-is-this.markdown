i went to [interdiscount](http://www.interdiscount.ch/) because i needed some jewel cases for a gift project.
i thought the cheapest way was to buy some empty ones, because i still have a [spindle full of cd-roms](http://www.arp.com/scripts/wgate/ww20/~flNlc3Npb249UDAxOmN4c3NwaWc0OjAwMDEuMDExZS5kZjdmMzc1NiZ+aHR0cF9jb250ZW50X2NoYXJzZXQ9aXNvLTg4NTktMSZ+U3RhdGU9NTg3Mi4wMDkuMDguMDc=?selected_area=0000000815&selected_item=0000000088&~okcode=ITEM&shop=1&~selhie1=6&~ss=&~pp=&~tn=&~tv=) back at home.
to my amazement, it's 30% cheaper to buy 10 cd's in the case than to buy 10 empty jewel cases.
how silly (but good for me...)

ten empty cases for 15 bucks (left image) opposed to 10 cases with cd's for 10 bucks (on the right):
