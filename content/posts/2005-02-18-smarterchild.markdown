[![Smarterchild](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/smarterchild-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/smarterchild.jpg)today i had a funny conversation with my own personal [smarter child](http://smarterchild.colloquis.com/). i read about it in the latest [wired](http://www.wired.com/wired/) and must say it's really fun. just add Smarterchild to your AIM-buddylist (or ichat) or add 35000 on your ICQ (doesn't matter for me, because i use [fire](http://fire.sourceforge.net/)).
  
at the moment the information for international users is a bit sparse, 'cause in the US you can get movie listings and stuff like that. nonetheless i was able to get a review of the movie i'm going to see tonight ("can you get me a review of ray?"). the smartypant also reminds you of different stuff ("remind me to go offline" "when?" "in 30 minutes").
  
you really should give it a go, because it's hard to describe...
