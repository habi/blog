as you can see in [the entry below](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000252.html) i'm now able to post pictures directly from [iphoto](http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/), it's still bit quirky, but the [software](http://esigler.2nw.net/software/iphoto2weblog_merging_content_management_systems) i used is still in it's beta stage, so bear with the author. 
the photos i blogged directly from my iphoto are from our stay in vienna, one is the town-hall with nina, the other pics are from the restaurant [raan](http://www.raan.at/), which was more than lovely, i had a vegetarian sushi which was among the best asian stuff i ever ate! a big recommendation if you're ever gonna go to vienna!

**update**: it doesn't seem to work well in iphoto4 (which i installed this afternoon) so i just start using [ecto](http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/), which has quite a nifty iphoto-integration...
