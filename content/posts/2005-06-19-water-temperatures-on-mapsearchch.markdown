[![Wassertemperaturen](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/wassertemperaturen-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/wassertemperaturen.jpg)[those guys](http://about.search.ch/) are geeks, but also know where to make some funny additions to their code :-)



[map.search.ch](http://map.search.ch/) now features the water temperature of some pools and lakes in switzerland (e.g. in [bern](http://map.search.ch/bern?x=16&y=550&z=512), where i just came from...).
  
they're pulling in the data from [wiewarm.ch](http://wiewarm.ch/), so if your favorite pool is not listed, you know where to go.
  
happy swimming!
