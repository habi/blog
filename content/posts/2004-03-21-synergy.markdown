since my migration to panther i was looking for a decent controller for itunes. the problem was, that my favorite freeware app ([PTHitunesnotifier](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/16107&vid=109046), now a 70$ shareware: [youcontrol](http://www.yousoftware.com/products/control.php)) to control itunes did not work on panther.
the problem is, that i often want to switch to the next track, because i'm not in the mood to listen to the current one (i have a really broad library of about 1500 songs, which are normally set to play on random, so sometimes the one coming up, doesn't fit).
up to now i could achieve that with [keyboard maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) which did the hot-key control for itunes, sparing me the right-click on the dock-icon of itunes and then selecting: "next song". i can just hit F7 to pause or F8 to skip to the next song, greatly decreasing the change to get distracted from my current task.
one thing i was missing though is the announcement of the current song, which was what PTHitunesnotifier did really nicely for me.
![synergy](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/synergy.jpg)that's where [synergy](http://synergy.wincent.com/) comes in handy. it has a nice pop-up window - called [floater](http://synergy.wincent.com/floater.html) - which announces the current track (as seen on the left). synergy also has good [hotkey-control](http://synergy.wincent.com/hotkeys.html) for itunes, so my F7 and F8-keys have something to do, and features also a nifty [menu-bar control](http://synergy.wincent.com/menubar.html), which comes in handy sometimes. the only drawback is that it costs 5â‚¬, so it's not free. 
but hey, i can start it ten times until it wants the serial, which makes it possible for me to use it for free for nearly three months if i do not [reboot too often](http://uptimes.hostingwired.com/account.php?op=details&hid=8399) :-) 
and then i will gladly shell out those bucks if i haven't found anything better...

do you use a controller for itunes or have a better suggestion for me? leave a comment.
