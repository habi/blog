it's been raining so much the last days here in bern, that [the pope](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=papst+besuch+bern&btnG=Search) can be happy he'll stay so high up here (actually in [piece's neighborhood](http://www.web-laun.ch/pieceoBlog/index.php?p=1126)).
i'm quite happy i didn't need to bike today, because the nether regions of bern were [not bikeable](http://www.bernergazette.ch/archives/000415.html) today and because i'm ill again. so i'm not gonna stay up any longer, but go to bed and stay there as long as possible tomorrow.
nightynight!
