i've officially killed my [two](http://habi.bild.li/) [moblogs](http://moblog.co.uk/blogs.php?show=835) [1]. from now on, all my (seldom) moblogging is going to happen here: [http://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/moblog/](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/moblog/). regarding that, i've also uncluttered my sidebar a bit. the latest images-section now shows the five latest images i posted to flickr. on top there's the latest moblog, then the four latest "normal" images.



i achieved this with a mashup of the code of two [flickr-badges](http://www.flickr.com/badge_new.gne). the first one is pulling just the "moblog" tag, the second one is pulling the last 4 images.
  
the full code looks like this, nothing too fancy really:


<blockquote>

  
<tr >
  

> <td >
  
<table cellpadding="0" border="0" cellspacing="10" >
  

  

  
</table>
  

> </td>
  
</tr>
  

</blockquote>


the code is really straight-forward.
  
i just cleaned out the css and merged the two javascript parts. if you want to adopt it for your page, you just have to change the user-number and/or tag [2].



[1]: they've been clinically dead anyway...
  
[2]: a simple google search yielded [this](http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=7030&p=4): "To get your NSID from Flickr, go to your photos page, view source, find global_nsid, and note the value. Thatâ€™s it."
