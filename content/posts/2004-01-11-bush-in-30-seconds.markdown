If you haven't seen the ironic ads for the Bush administration up to now, then it's a good time to go to [bush in 30 seconds](http://www.bushin30seconds.com/).

all the ads are made to explains what this US-president bush and his policies are really about - in only 30 seconds - and under a [creative commons license](http://creativecommons.org/learn/). the whole contest is a project of [moveon.org](http://www.moveon.org/), a catalyst website '[to bring ordinary people back into politics](http://www.moveon.org/about/)' which wants to create an ad to challege bush's politics and politicians.
most of the ads are well worth the 30 seconds, go watch them, or as [glider](http://iam.bmezine.com/?glider) said: I hope the people who need to see these watch them.

**btw**: today at 11pm EST the winner of the little contest is to be announced live on the aforementioned webpage. 
my personal favorite is "[in my country](http://www.bushin30seconds.com/view/03_small.shtml)". "[child's pay](http://www.bushin30seconds.com/view/01_small.shtml)" is really nicely made in terms of film-craftsmanship (and [b.](http://bernhardseefeld.ch/)'s preferred ad) and "[desktop](http://www.bushin30seconds.com/view/10_small.shtml)" is really simple and funny.
