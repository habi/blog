[![Upcoming Events](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/upcoming_events-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/upcoming_events.jpg)i'm starting to really dig those social web-apps.
  
one the last discoveries of mine is [upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/) [1]. upcoming. org is a social event calendar driven by people like you and me. people can manage their events there and i have a neat way of showing some of my upcoming stuff i'm planning to attend or just got in my date book.
  
in addition to that, i can subscribe to events for a certain city i like (as in "[bern](http://upcoming.org/metro/ch/be/bern/)", "[z√ºrich](http://upcoming.org/metro/ch/zh/zh/)", "[tashkent](http://upcoming.org/metro/uz/ta/)" or "[trachselwald](http://upcoming.org/metro/ch/be/tra/)"). or subscribe to events of a certain person, no matter city they take place. the subscription is possible as an rss-feed or as as a ical-calendar-file. so if you like, you can add the calendars of your buddies to your ical and see what events they go to and take part or start to stalk them :-)



i've started to add some venues and events in bern and hope this starts to catch up in my 'hood :-)



and i also thought this might be a nice way of "collecting" the people that want to come to [certain](http://upcoming.org/event/34222/) [meetings](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/bloggertreffen/). let's see if it starts to take off a bit more. if you add yourself to upcoming.org, send me a note and we can start to share our events...



which leads me to the title of this post: "... in the sidebar" [2]. since the events can be shown to any site with the [upcoming.org badge](http://upcoming.org/badge/), i've added my next 5 events to the sidebar. with some css-tinkering it also looks like it belongs in the sidebar. so if you want to see what i plan to to in the next few weeks, then you can now peek there (but i'm not gonna tell you stuff that i plan to visit [the einstein exhibit](http://www.bhm.ch/de/ausstellungen_sonder_01.cfm) with nina this weekend, so no stalking me...).



[1] [which got bought by yahoo yesterday](http://upcoming.org/news/archives/2005/10/05/yahoo_ac/index.php), which made every news-site post about that, which made me tinker around with it a bit more. so it's actually a re-discovery, i can't remember when i first encountered it. what i know is, that i encountered it much later than [b.](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/) (just look at [my](http://upcoming.org/user/14920/) or his [user](http://upcoming.org/user/501/) number...).
  
[2] time for all you rss-feed-readers to visit my site
