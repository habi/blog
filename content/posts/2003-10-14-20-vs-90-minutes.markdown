and i already feel lonely.



explanation: nina has to finish her studies (pharmaceutics) in either zurich, basel or geneva and she chose zurich for obvius reasons (the [ETH](http://www.ethz.ch/) in zurich is very renowned).  

i stay here in bern for the moment. so we stop living 20 minutes apart, which makes me kinda sad.  

i hope - from deep inside my heart - that this is only a test for our relationship and not a stumbling block! i know that i won't be that big of a problem, there's telephones, and normally she'll come back to bern on the weekends and we'll shurely manage to see each other during the week from time to time. but still the possibility to see each other spontaneous kinda does not work anymore...  

nina, i love you!
