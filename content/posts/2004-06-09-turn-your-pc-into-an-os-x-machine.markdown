do you own a windows xp machine and want to be able to look at the same nice desktop as i do all the time?
do you have a winXP-machine at work, but miss you nice os x box at home?
then you only have to take the steps described [here](http://www.engadget.com/entry/8828351836181248/) and you feel at home instantly. but be aware there is still windows running under the nice looking shell, so you might need to reboot from time to time :-)
