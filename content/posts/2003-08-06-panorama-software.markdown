does someone of my fellow blog readers know a good panorama stitching software for OS X?
i'm currently using [LM Stitch](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/17359&mode=feedback), which is a software which just keeps working  in demo mode (as opposed to the [Stitcher EZ](http://www.realviz.com/products/stez/index.php) from Realviz which refuses to work after 30 days).
But the problem with LM Stitch is that the [UI](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/archives/000029.html) is really awkward and not very useable.
Any suggestions are more than welcome. I would really like to use the [Pano-Tools](http://www.panoguide.com/software/reviews/panotools_v21.html), but Adobe Photoshop is just too much for my wallet!

The image below is just a 3 minutes hack of a little panorama from images i made this past weekend in [silvaplana](http://www.silvaplana.ch/html/sleep/camp/camp.html) (b/w because of the demo-version):
