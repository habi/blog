if you look in the sidebar then you see a new feature: "last comments".
i borrowed a code-snippet from [stuart mutie](http://www.stuartmudie.net/blog/000016.html), adapted it a tiny bit and now you can see the last comments that were posted here on the site.  

this is my snippet of code, use it and abuse it!






<$MTComments lastn="5"$ sort_order="descend">  

[<$MTCommentAuthorLink spam_protect="1"$>:  

<MTCommentBody trim_to="45" remove_html="1" convert_breaks="0">  

<a href="<$MTBlogArchiveURL$>  

<$MTCommentEntryID pad="1"$>.html" title="read the whole buzz">>>  

</a>]<br />  

</MTComments>


and i got another one in the working, a hit-parade of most active commenters, coming soon....



now it's time to go and read [that NZZ-Folio](http://flagr.antville.org/stories/675415/).
