[![thoemu-bikeline](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/thoemu-bikeline-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/thoemu-bikeline.png)this morning i went to [thomu](http://www.thoemus.ch) to see if he has any good bikes to offer (he has). i knew that my mom went to [roschu](http://bikeline.ch/) around noon to buy a bike for herself today, so i tried to be there as fast as possible (because i wanted to help her a bit and was already late).  

the calculated route from oberried to roschus shop (according to [map24.ch](http://thoemus.ch/)) is 11.39 km and takes 19 minutes. with my bike i drove the 9.34 km in 13 minutes and 50 seconds, resulting in an average speed of 40.5 km per hour. not too bad, aight?
now the question is, do i really need a bike that is faster than the one i already own? answer: yes, because it's even more fun to drive fast with a racing bike than with a street-capable mountain bike.

oh, and in the end it turns out that i'm gonna decide between the [bmc streetfire ssx](http://www.bmc-racing.com/bikes.cfm?lang=eng&catID=4&modID=28) (from [our shop](http://velokurierladen.ch/01laden.html)) or the [specialized](http://bikeline.ch/) [allez comp](http://www.specialized.com/SBCBkModel.jsp?spid=5967) or the [thomus](http://thoemus.ch/) [slicker team pro](http://thoemus.ch/a_html/bikes/2004/sliker-team-pro.htm). (guesss which one is the cheapest for me...) it's a really hard decision. the price difference between all three bikes is less than 5% (i'm not gonna tell how cheap (compared to the real price) i get them) so it's more of a "which dealer do i like most"-question...).
and in the end i also get 1k swiss franks from the insurance of the girl that trashed my bike. it's not as much as i hoped, but at least the new bike is not gonna be as painful on my bank-account.
