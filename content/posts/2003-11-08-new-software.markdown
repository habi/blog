if you own a [mac](http://www.apple.com/), then go and download these two:  




	
  * [sidetrack](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/sidetrack/index.html)

	
  * [collage](http://www.trinfinitysoftware.com/collage.shtml)


sidetrack is definitely a must! i never thought i'd miss these features until i installed this nifty piece of software. sidetrack is a replacement driver for your trackpad on the mac. it enables scrolling features i now heavily rely on (it almost makes my mouse obsolete...). you now get a defined zone on your trackpad in which you can scroll the screen (preferably the left part for vertical and the top part for horizontal scrolling...)


collage is a funny little plugin for [itunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) which displays freely available images from the internet as a visualisation. it's quite hard to explain, just give it a go.  

ah, and most important: both pieces are freeware.
