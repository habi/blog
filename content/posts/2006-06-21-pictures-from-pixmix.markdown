[![Pixmixsimpleviewer](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/pixmixsimpleviewer-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/pixmixsimpleviewer.jpg)if you missed the pixmix tonight, then you can see all the images i showed in the [/pics](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/) section, in the folder [pixmix13](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/pixmix13/).



this time i used a new gallery-export-program which is built around [simpleviewer](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/simpleviewer/)/[postcardviewer](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/projects/postcardviewer/) [1].
  
simple- and postcardviewer are a free flash image viewing application with a visually pleasing result. the thing that makes it supereasy to export galleries or folders is [iphoto export](http://www.hagus.net/taxonomy/term/14) from [hagus.net](http://hagus.net/).
  
choose a folder or gallery in iphoto, choose the viewer and press export. voila. and all freeware, free as in eggerbier [2].
  
wait 'till all the images are loaded and it looks like in the screenshot above, then click on any of the images. the stack of images is randomly ordered, but i kinda like that :-)



let me know if you like that kind of gallery more than the old...



[1] rediscovered via [lanz](http://www.slanz.ch/).
  
[2] you might only get that if you've been at the pixmix tonight...
