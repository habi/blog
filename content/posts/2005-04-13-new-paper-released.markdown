i wonder if the paper i just finished is going to help me with my already long-running quest for finding a job in the field i learned. i guess it needs still some corrections and additions. if you want to read it, then just click on the link below:
  
[David Haberthuer - Emulating Smalltalk and Von Neumann Machines Using Semantical](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/habipaper.pdf) (100kb .pdf). you need to scroll down to see the images, i think they turned out quite good.
