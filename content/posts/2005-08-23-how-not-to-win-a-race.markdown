raph[1] posted a funny movie over at velocites blog: [how not to win a race](http://www.blennus.com/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=443&Itemid=) (.wmv-plugin necessary). rather bad luck.



[1] he returned from basel as [the fastest european messenger](http://velocite.ch/weblogtoo/?p=180). and [rachel and nicola](http://velokurierbern.ch/popup.html) from bern also are european champions, rachel was the fastest woman on track and nicola is the best bunny-hopper. congratulations from me!
