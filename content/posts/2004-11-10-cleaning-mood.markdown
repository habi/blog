altough it was my free day, i had to get up early today, because we got [a new fridge](http://moblog.co.uk/view.php?id=31386), so i thought it's about time to do some cleaning. after i've cleaned out my closets and thrown away a bag full of junk i started to catalog my dvd's (call me obsessive) with the excellent [dvdpedia](http://www.bruji.com/dvdpedia/) (which i bought rightaway for 18 bucks).
  
[![Dvdlibrary-pdf, optimized for screen](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/dvdlibrary_screen-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/dvdlibrary_screen.pdf)so you are now able to marvel at my collection of 106 dvds. actually at least two of them are missing, [ghost in the shell](http://imdb.com/title/tt0113568/) and [the crow](http://imdb.com/title/tt0109506/), but i forgot to whom i borrowed them. but this is never gonna happen again, because dvdpedia has a neat "borrowed to..."-feature which integrates nicely with address book.app on os x. if you click on the image on the left, you can download a three-paged pdf (300kb) of all the dvd-covers which i exported with dvdpedia.
  
do you want to borrow one?
  
send me an email!
