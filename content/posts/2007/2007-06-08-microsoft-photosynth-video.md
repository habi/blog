the [ted-talks](http://www.ted.com/talks) are always a good source for inspiration and sometimes are just pure eyecandy and droolworthy innovations.
i've added them to my [democracy-player](http://www.getdemocracy.com/) but seldom take my time to watch all of them. the [demo](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/129) of photosynth and seadragon by [Blaise Aguera y Arcas](http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers/view/id/117) from microsoft research is amazing. now this should be combined with [jeff hans multi-touch interface](https://habi.gna.ch/2007/01/23/multi-touch-demo/), and i'll never leave my desk again...
sometimes even microsoft manages to do impressive stuff!

i couldn't embed the original talk from ted.com, so i linked to the youtube-version. if you want to see the full eyecandy, go here: [ted.com/talks/view/id/129](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/129)

microsoft provides a [demo](http://labs.live.com/photosynth/), so you can play with photosynth. unfortunately, the demo only on windos, so i might need to reboot to boot camp or see if [[kju:]](http://www.kju-app.org/kju/) is capable of doing it...
