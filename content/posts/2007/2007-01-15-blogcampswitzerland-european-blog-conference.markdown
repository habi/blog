[![Bc Logo 300](https://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/Bc_logo_300.png)](https://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/Bc_logo_300.png)the same group behind barcamp Remo Uhere, Dominik Tarolli, William Lüthi und Peter Hogenkamp un-organise the upcoming [blogcamp](http://barcamp.ch/BlogCampSwitzerland) on the 24th of march at the ETH in zürich. it's supposed to be a conference focusing exclusively on blogging, organized by bloggers for bloggers and is built upon the principles of the famous BarCamp (ad-hoc unconference) in the Silicon Valley. barcamp was really nice and interesting, i've met a load of [geeky people](https://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/barcamp) and suppose blogcamp is also gonna be as nice and interesting.

i've added it to my calendar, and hope to attend [1], it's gonna be a good way to meet people from the swiss blogosphere, (e.g. [Claudia](http://virg0.org/), who's been commenting here lately [2]), listen to interesting talks [3] and generally just have a good time.
if you're interested to come, get yourself signed up at the [wiki](http://barcamp.ch/BlogCampSwitzerland#Participants) and if you want to present, just add yourself to the list of the talkers.

oh, and i've added it to [upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/event/140920)...

[1] might be on holidays with my darling...
[2] she seems to be on maintenance at the moment..
[3] leu, kommt prototyp v2.0?

**update:** corsin informed me via email that it's not him and gabor (who organised barcamp) who organise the blogcamp, but the four i added at the beginning. sorry, i didn't wanna steal any credits :-)
