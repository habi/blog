[![Applestoreborked](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/applestoreborked-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/applestoreborked.jpg)dear apple.



i just spent an hour and a half to layout a book (for a gift) in iphoto. now, that i want to buy it, you inform me, that my credit-card cannot be accepted for this transaction. i double-checked with my credit-card-company, and yes, my card is fully valid and within its limit, so there's nothing wrong with that. and i'd also love to buy [sunny days](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=72601344&selectedItemId=72600856), but that also doesn't work.
  
and hey, it's a gift which i need soon, so what can i do?



don't wonder, i already called at the apple help line, but they're closed so late in the evening...
