today i got an email from the [flickr-team](http://flickr.com/): in the aftermath of yahoo buying flickr the guys and gals are able to provide [more stuff for all the users](http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2005/04/new_prices_free.html):



- 20 mb upload limit for all free users
  
- for all pro users (like me), e.g. those who paid for an extended account: an extension to two years, so i get double the bang for my bucks and
  
- 2 invites for a pro account to give away.



this leads me to a little contest: i'm donating those two accounts to you, yes you. but because i (occasionally) get more than two readers, you have to fight :-)
  
send me a convincing picture or something other that justifies the donation of an account from me to you [1].



[1]: since there's a bit more involved than with a [gmail invite](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&search=gmail), the hurdles are also a bit higher. i think, for instance, i must know you (least a bit) personally and must think that i could like your pictures...
