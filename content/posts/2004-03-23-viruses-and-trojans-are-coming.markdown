in the current [weltwoche](http://www.weltwoche.ch/)* there's an [article](http://www.weltwoche.ch/artikel/?AssetID=7248&CategoryID=60) about hackers and coders which was not too bad (although a bit pop-science).
i really had to laugh about the worm that [Philet0ast3r](http://www.google.com/search?q=Philet0ast3r&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) programmed:



<blockquote>Ein anderer [Wurm], an dem er gerade arbeitet, installiert zwei gesprachsfahige Programme auf dem befallenen Computer, die dann in einem Pop-up-Fenster auftauchen und nervos miteinander daruber sprechen, ob es hier eine Antivirus-Software gibt und ob diese sie womoglich aufspuren und vernichten kann.</blockquote>



sounds really funny, makes me want to run that on a windows-machine and watching those two, while not being able to stop laughing hysterically. really!

note1: do those two programs talk in one window or is it in two windows? you see, the article was not very in-depth about the specifics of programming or so, just an enjoyable read.

note2: the [english version](http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/000704.html) of the article can be found on [clive thompsons](http://www.collisiondetection.net/) site

note3: are there still personal websites that are not blogs?
