in the past times when i used to play tetris on my gameboy i once had a  dream where i was nearly squashed by those falling blocks. i managed to finish the game multiple times in the hardest setting (which was rewarded with a [starting space-shuttle](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000286.html)).
this bloke does an absolute fabulous job at [playing tetris](http://fun.drno.de/movies/TetrisJapanFinals.mpeg)! (12.7mb .mpeg-file)

oh, and there's also a nice tetris-clone for os x: [quinn](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/10063). the funny thing is, that quinn has a network feature, you can play a game over the net. if anyone wants to give it a go with a network-match just send me a quick note, i'll be happy to try out a  match :-)
