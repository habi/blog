[piece](http://www.web-laun.ch/pieceoBlog/index.php?p=1354) lately mentioned [a night at the hip-hopera from the kleptones](http://www.kleptones.com/pages/downloads_hiphopera.html). according to me this is THE mashup album of the year. although the album as a whole is illegal it is quite brilliant, mixing the best songs from the hiphop-spere into an album with great flow.
[boingboing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/28/catalogue_of_the_kle.html) posted a link to [waxy's blog](http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/09/23/kleptone.shtml) where he collaboratively tries to identify all samples used in the 23 great songs! i've been listening to those songs  all morning long, they're great, go and grab them while they're hot!
on waxy's page you can also download the files, he's generously hosting them. or else you go to the kleptones' page, they point you to some mirrors to download all the songs (either as [one big file](http://www.archive.org/http://shell.exo.com/~boogah/kleptones_-_anathh.zip) (109mb .zip), as [23 individual files](http://www.nathanntg.com/mirror/kleptones_opera/) or - if you like that - as a [bittorent file](http://www.kleptones.com/pages/The%20Kleptones%20-%20A%20Night%20At%20The%20Hip-Hopera.torrent)).
