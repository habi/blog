well this is amazing.
i thought - now that i'm a [teacher](http://habi.bild.li/1063/view.html) - i need something practical to carry my files from home to school instead of burning them on a cd, emailing them to myself or carrying my ibook to school.
so i bought one of these USB-memorysticks with 128mb capacity.

today it was in the mail and i have to say i was truly surprised how small this thingy is (good there was a little hand-leash included :-)

it's about the size of my [pinkie](http://dict.leo.org/?p=5qvU.&search=pinkie) .

PS: and don't be surprised that it says USB 2.0 on it. it was the cheapest one on [ricardo.ch](http://ricardo.ch/) and it works like a charm on my oldfashioned vanilla-flavoured USB-port :-)
