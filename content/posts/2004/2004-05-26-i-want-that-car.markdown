[![volta](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/volta-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/volta.jpg) today the newest [wired](http://wired.com/wired/archive/12.06/) arrived.
as always, when scanning it for worthwhile stuff to read, my eyes get caught on the ["fetish" page](http://wired.com/wired/archive/12.06/play.html?pg=12). nope, it's not your normal fetish like latex and leather and stuff like that, but shining and gleaming gadgets and gizmos.
this time, the wired staff portrayed the [toyota volta](http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/future/volta.html), a hybrid concept car.
the volta is the bigger and much much spiffier brother of the [toyota prius](http://www.toyota.com/prius/), which is a really big hit in the us.
i presume that hybrid cars are the only way electric cars are ever gonna be popular. (heck, even [gearbits](http://www.gearbits.com/archives/000733.html) loves it :-)
a hybrid car is - for all those that do not know - a car that has both a conventional engine and an electrical engine.
both share the work, the electrical engine all the work where a conventional one is not good, e.g. accelerating and small burst of power, and the conventional engine comes to help when maximal power is needed, like on auto-routes.
thus, such cars manage to be really fuel-efficient and environmentally safe (at least many of times safer than a normal car) while leaving the man or woman behind the steering wheel with the experience of a real car, so no charging of the battery or searching for that hydrogen filling stations.

and hey, who could argue with a sports car ([0-100 km/h in 4 seconds](http://www.auto123.com/en/info/news/news,view.spy?artid=21889)) that uses only [1 liter of fuel on 100km](http://www.auto123.com/en/info/news/news,view.spy?artid=21889&pg=2)? (and is named after a famous [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta) :-)

oh, and by the way, i'm not really a car-fan, this is just as geeky as it can get...
