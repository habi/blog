check out [phil torrones](http://www.philliptorrone.com/) portable geek gym, which he posted on his [geek-blog](http://www.flashenabled.com/).
you have to watch the [movie](http://www.philliptorrone.com/geekgym/portablegeekgymii.mov) (.mov, 2.8 mb) to get the point, the [picture](http://www.flashenabled.com/nimages/portablegeekgymii.jpg) does not fully account the geekness of it.
