gadget envy.
at [miklos' and cecilia's wedding](https://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/sets/15757/) b. and me talked about the upcoming [motorola razr](http://www.motorola.com/mdirect/hellomoto/experience/v3/flash/default.shtml), the phone that looks like THE gadget-ency-inducing phone of the year. up to now i've only seen one or to pics of it floating around on the net. but today i stumbled over [this thread at howard forums](http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=428896)1 which induced a cringe in my bowels, (a soft wispering voice: buybuybuybuy). under one of a gazillion pictures of the razr was the one in the post below, the guy holding the phone in his hands.
can you believe motorola crammed:


   
  * a vga-camera
   
  * bluetooth
  
  * a speakerphone
   
  * a color screen
   
  * and mp3-ringtones
into that aluminium encasing?
it's a bummer that phone is expected to cost around [0.5kChf](http://www.mobilezone.ch/index.php?lang=de&cat=2&action=viewproductdetail&ProductID=1209) even with a contract...

1 don't click on the link if you're on a dial-up line, it's crammed with pictures.
don't click on the link if you don't want to see a girl in a strange bikini!
and what's it with that knife?
