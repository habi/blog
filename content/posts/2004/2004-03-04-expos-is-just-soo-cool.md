as i [installed](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000233.html) everything from scratch, [clutter](http://www.sprote.com/clutter/index.html) now lacks quite a lot of my albums pictures.
with expose it's a breeze to update these. a quick [google](http://images.google.com/) of the album tittle, click and hold, [f9](http://www.sprote.com/clutter/index.html), drop onto clutter. et voila!
couldn't be easier than this.
before i had to save the image to the desktop, minimize safari, locate the image on my cluttered desktop, get clutter to the foreground and drag the image to clutters window (direct drag and drop did not work, because through some mysterious bug all the images dragged to clutter arrived upside down.)
