since the [swiss farmers](http://www.schweizerbauer.ch/) lately informed me on the radio that the swiss strawberries are here and that they're sweet and gorgeous and stuff like that i could hardly resist to buy some on friday. but the farmers must have some really strange fertilizers, because one of the strawberries was huuuuuge!
see for yourself:

ps1: the first picture doesn't do her justice, nina is much much prettier [IRL](http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&Acronym=irl&Find=Find)! 
ps2: just for the record: if you want to be informed about the prices for slaughter cattle every friday afternoon, you can get a free [sms-newsletter](http://www.schweizerbauer.ch/service/newsletter/index.html) from the swiss farmers (sorry, only availiable in switzerland).
