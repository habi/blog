[![nested](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/nested-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/nested.jpg)my internal harddisk is acting extremely funky, and making weird clicking noises all the time.
at first i presumed it's extreme overheating, cause i was doing some very processor-intensive work yesterday eveing. (rendering a huge mosaic with MacOSaiX). but this afternoon it's not back to normal the weird clicking sound is still there.
thank god i have got a bootable backup so i can try to do some debugging.
after i booted from my external harddisk i started the disk utility from the backup and tried to verify the startup disk (the internal harddisk on my ibook). after a short while disk utility tells me that "the nesting of folders has exeeded the limit" which is beyond my explanation (see image on the left). i hope disk utility can fix this...

[![nested2](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/nested2-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/nested2.jpg)**update:** doesn't seem so. i guess then it's time for some major debugging. maybe i can find the hundreds of nested folders...
