the comment spam on the blog is slowly getting out of control (but will be stopped as soon as i can install the new version of moveable type, which will happen soon).
  
although mtblacklist is an indispensable piece of software, which is blocking a huge amount of comment spam i have to delete some spam from time to time.
  
one comment spam i'm not gonna delete is the last comment [here](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000459.html), because i thought it's well funny: a team of microsoft engineers - [the IE Team](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/) - tries to sue me, because i installed firefox. ha!
  
guys, get it: i'm happily using safari on os x. but i also installed firefox, mostly to see how well it does. and as long as you work on a windows-machine i higly suggest you go and [download it now](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/), it's supposed to be far better than IE and don't be afraid of some cheeky guys threatening to sue you, try it!
