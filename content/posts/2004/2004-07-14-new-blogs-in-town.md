here are the three new blogs i added to my rss-reader:

[bill gates' blog](http://billgatesblog.blogspot.com/)

[hulks' blog](http://incrediblehulk.blogspot.com/) (hilarious!)

[miklos' new blog](http://kozary.com/blog/) which is passwordprotected for some reason, but you might get a password if you ask nicely.

(guess which one i added for for real :-)
