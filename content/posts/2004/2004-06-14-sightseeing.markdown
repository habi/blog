[![pc](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/pc-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/pc.jpg)today i went to donate blood. when i arrived at the place there was a big [brouhaha](http://dict.leo.org/?search=brouhaha). after some time i found out that today was the ["first worldwide donate blood day"](http://www.srk.ch/activities/health/news/890909902860/news_html?newsid=890909902860) and that [swiss federal councilor](http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/cf/brauto.html) [pascal couchepin](http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/cf/br/107.html) donated blood in the same place as i did (actually on the bed opposite mine :-)
i guess i should have moblogged it, because i'd have surely been faster than the swiss red cross with their media bulletin (linked above).  

if you have a hard time spotting PC on my pic above (he's the third from the right) then you can also see him in [piece](https://pieceoplastic.com/)'s [classe politique calendar](http://www.web-laun.ch/laclassepolitique2004/),  mr. PC was the [march pinup](http://www.web-laun.ch/laclassepolitique2004/march.html).
