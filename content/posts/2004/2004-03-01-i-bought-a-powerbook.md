but it is only made from cardboard :-)
[filewile](http://www.filewile.com/filewile.php)'s new single comes in a beautiful [hand-crafted](http://www.filewile.com/html/qt/chumpnrun.html) limited-edition card-board-special-media-8"-powerbook. [(and it's yours for only 35 bucks](http://www.filewile.com/html/shop.php)).
and have you read [the article](http://www.filewile.com/media/press/bund_270204.pdf) about their journey to the uk? (96kb .pdf)

oh, and the chumpnrun-video (which is also on the single) is absolutely hilarious. 
i hope to see it on telly sometimes, it's really good! 
go andy and dejot!

**update**: it turns out that i'm quite lucky. the limited edition single won't officially be available until the 17th of march! so i already know the song with the incredible sassy hook-line and i own a limited piece of art, there are only 300 filewile-power-books available for sale, then they're gone for good.
