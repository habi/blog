the first one is funny: the point of the online-game on [wagenschenke.ch](http://www.wagenschenke.ch/) is to walk back home with well too much alcohol. i managed to walk 75 meters this morning, when hamme showed me that game, but i cannot seem to replicate the result now to post a screenshot, maybe i'll be able to do that later.

the second one is interesting in a physicists way: the [new scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99996092) points out that the speed of light might have changed recently, which would change a lot in traditional physics (read the article to get the point of "recently"). the change in the constant c would imply some problems with other constants, but is quite handy in a greater view, e.g. if you want to explain some interesting things like the horizon-problem in our universe (again, this is a physicist kind of problem, so you don't need to worry :-)

**[update]**
i managed to grab a screenshot this morning: 77m! how much do you get? leave a comment.
