yesterday i was snowboarding in [sanenmoser](http://www.skigstaad.ch), and it was really lovely, although i bailed really really hard, and now it looks like i just broke a rib (at least that's what my doctor said on the phone, i'm gonna go and see later on today...)


**update**: the doctor found out that two of my ribs are broken (not all the way through, so it's not a real problem, just a major pain in the ass.)
the only remedy is that i eat [ponstan](http://www.pfizer.ch/internet/de/home/products/rheumatology/non_steroidale_anti_inflammatory/ponstan_mefenacid.html) (or actually a [generika](https://google.com/search?q=generika&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) called [spiralgin](http://www.kompendium.ch/app/Info_pi_d.cfm?Search=05517)) for about a month and a half...
