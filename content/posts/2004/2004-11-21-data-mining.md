[![Smartspider](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/smartspider-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/smartspider.jpg)next weekend there are elections here in switzerland. i'm not overly politically interested, but i think voting is a must. so i heavily rely on tools to help me make the decision. i've already mentioned [both](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000068.html) of [them](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000312.html) here ([smartvote](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000312.html) and [votez.ch](http://www.votez.ch)).
  
smartvote enables you to generate your political profile, the so called smartspider. and then it matches your spider to all the candidates and proposes you a list of people to choose. votez is another tool, where all the different initiatives are explained with the pros and cons, so that any normal person is able to understand it and vote accordingly.
  
so, if my political spectrum interest you, you can click on the picture on the left and start to discuss this in the comments. now if i only could have printed out the generated list and dropped it in the box instead of having to write down all the 80 names the whole process would even be more easy.
