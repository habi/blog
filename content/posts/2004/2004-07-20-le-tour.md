since the timedifference between the finishers of [le grand boucle](http://www.letour.fr/2004/us/index.html) on sunday is probably gonna be minuscule i thought it's interesting to know how people actually figure out who comes in first or not after those 180km stages.
[engadget](http://www.engadget.com/) has a nice little [explanation](http://www.engadget.com/entry/8424422553253965/) on all the high-tech involved in the timekeeping of the [tour de france](http://www.letour.fr/2004/us/index.html).
