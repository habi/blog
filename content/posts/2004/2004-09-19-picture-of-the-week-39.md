yesterday i've been on a big hike with nina and her sister. we walked over the so-called hohturli from the griesalp to kandersteg ([here's the explanation from another guy](http://members.aol.com/HokieHokieHi/)).

on the descent to kandersteg we witnessed the sun going down over the hills on the other side of the valley. since the air was a little hazy i was able to catch the sun rays quite nice.

ps: i've made a nice panorama on 2778m above sea level, i'll post that soon, but it needs some more tweaking and i need a bed now.
ps2: here are some other pictures on [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/sets/12071/). (i start to like that!)
