i do own a pong for my telly (a really lucky finding at the local second hand store for 15 bucks) but this fully-analog pong from two german students is way more cool. it's built with pulleys, strings and pieces of glass. go and [visit their site](http://www.cyberniklas.de/pongmechanik/index.html) and watch the video (in [10mb](http://www.cyberniklas.de/pongmechanik/videos/video_high.html) and [6mb](http://www.cyberniklas.de/pongmechanik/videos/video_low.html)-flavour) with amazement!
