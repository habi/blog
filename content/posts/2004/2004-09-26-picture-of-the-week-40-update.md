my plan for yesterday was to go and see [freestyle.ch](http://www.freestyle.ch/freestyle2004) with [sigi](http://www.slf.ch/staff/pers-home/sigrist/sigrist-en.html), but since the [snowramp collapsed](http://www.freestyle.ch/freestyle2004/alert.php), the whole event was blown off (see a tiny pic [here](http://www.freestyle.ch/freestyle2004/mag_content/rampe.jpg)).
bugger! mostly also because i hope to get a good picture of the week :-)

so sigi and me went to the museum to see [der gespiegelte mensch](http://www.dergespiegeltemensch.ch/) (the mirrored human) which was mildly said, a disappointment (beside the microscopes with the [drosophila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila) and their mutations...).. so we just went to the so-called niederdorfli and drank some tea and coffee and had a good talk, which was probably ways better than watching reckless guys and gals on their boards and skies.

so i'm just grabbing a pic from my archive:
here's one i shot at kims stag night in crans montana:
