[![](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/greyalbum-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/greyalbum.jpg)public disobedience?
count me in!

**explanation**: dj danger mouse remixed [the white album](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDSUB040402241352592746&sql=Ajxkxikp6bbo9) of the beatles and [the black album](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDSUB040402241353523017&sql=A8vaxlfjeacqq) of jay-z which of course makes grey.
[dj danger mouse](http://www.djdangermouse.com/) (the man himself) explains it like this:

The Grey Album is an art project/experiment that uses the full vocal 
content of Jay-Z's Black Album recorded over new beats and production 
made using the Beatles White Album as the sole source material. 
Danger Mouse insists he can explain and prove that all the music 
on the Grey Album can be traced back to the White Album and its 
musical content via sampling. Every kick, snare, and chord is taken 
from the Beatles White Album and is in their original recording somwhere. 

the grey album has been hailed as a real hip-hop-triumph and i have to say that it's really awesome. only 3,000 copies of the album are in circulation, but nonetheless EMI sent cease and desist letters to danger mouse and the stores that were selling the album, demanding that the album be destroyed. so a [bunch](http://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html) [of](http://www.downhillbattle.org/) [people](http://www.web-laun.ch/djDangerMouse/index.html) host the album today as an act of public disobedience.
go and grab it, it will only last for [today](http://www.greytuesday.org/)!
