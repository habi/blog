that guy surely has a [foot fetish](http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:9lxTlif04tIJ:www.everythingtarantino.com/data/2003/0930-192005.shtml+kill+bill+foot+fetish&hl=de&ie=UTF-8)!
i just returned from seeing "[kill bill](https://imdb.com/title/tt0266697/)" in the most charming cinema in bern, the [abc](http://www.de.cineman.ch/kinoprogramm/theatre/detail.php?theatre_id=57) (so i can tick another task off my [2do list](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/extralineophobia.jpg) :-)
despite all the depicted brutality in the movie it's got very high class - like most [tarantino](https://imdb.com/name/nm0000233/) movies do - and is filmed in a very energizing way, mixing the timeline as almost all tarantino movies do, and mixing realfilm with a short anime-style episode. it surely leaves you with a deep urge to go see "[kill bill, volume 2](https://imdb.com/title/tt0378194/)", especially with that hook line at the end...
go and see it, if you haven't already...
