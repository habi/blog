today when i checked my mail i nearly couldn't believe it, i got 176 new mails in my [gna](http://gna.ch/)-inbox. first i thought it's a major hit of [mydoom.a](http://de.trendmicro-europe.com/enterprise/security_info/ve_detail.php?VName=WORM_MYDOOM.A), but then i found out, that it's just a major issue of blog-spam.
not too bad, the guy (i suppose it's a guy, so no offense to all my female readers...) managed to spam each and every entry on my blog. despite i have [MTBlacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/) installed, all the keywords he used slipped through MTBlacklist' filter.

it's gonna cost me quite some time do de-spam the whole blog.

ps: yes, i know i had 195 entries on my blog and only have 176 mails in my gna-inbox. the other 19 mails were filtered to my spam-box (which you can also see on the screenshot above) and were immediately deleted...

**update**: thanks to [spamcop](http://www.spamcop.net/sc?track=207.44.162.2) the people at [ev1](http://www.ev1.net/english/index.asp) got a little note, telling them that the ip [207.44.162.2](http://207.44.162.2/) did a massive spamming this morning... let's see what they do about.
