[franziska](http://www.foto-ff.com/) informed me that i got the job, so i'll be featured in a campaign of postfinance.
since this means some unscheduled hight tide in my wallet my technolust came up again and i thought, why not replace my trusty dsc-p9 with a new camera? and just as i surfed the web to compare the prices for the [dsc-t1](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0310/03102202sonydsct1.asp) (it's not [that expensive](http://toppreise.ch/prod_27986.html)!) i [found out](http://www.engadget.com/entry/0927137581413447/) that sony introduced some new cameras today, among other things the [dsc-t3](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0408/04082902sonydsct3.asp) and the [dsc-l1](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0408/04082903sonydscl1.asp). now i think i have to wait and see how expensive they're gonna be when they show up here in switzerland...

or i might just replace my [broken chair](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000299.html) with the red beauty that sits in el trapero's window, or i might get a new [ipod](https://apple.com/ipod/), or i might just book another dive-holiday, or...

**update**: the shooting was quite fun, but the picture will be horrible. two girls from the ad-agency took part in the shooting and decided that it looks a lot "trashier" when the snowboarder (which i depicted) wears his snowboarding boots together with normal jeans and a jumper, which looked really silly, but they seemed to like it. i think i'll be quite embarrassed when the ad comes out...
