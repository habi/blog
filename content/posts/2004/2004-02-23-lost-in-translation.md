tonight i'll go and see [lost in translation](https://imdb.com/title/tt0335266/) (or was it some [other title](https://pieceoplastic.com/index.php?p=857)?) with [mike](http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~upmw/).
i wonder if it's worth [the four stars the local newspaper gave it](http://asp.ebund.ch/bernerkino/artikel.asp?id=5245).
as a asia-ophile i really look forward to it. one of my dreams is to go to tokyo or some other big and rumorous asian city (be it honk-kong or peking or whatever). hopefully the movie will fuel this desire even more.
we'll see if that dream comes true...

**update**: piece asked if i liked the movie: yes, indeed! the "love"-story that unfolds between charlotte and bob is so romantic that i almost regretted watching the movie with mike :-) the movie is not an action-packed movie, there's not much stuff that really happens (in terms of hollywood-happening), most of the time you just watch bob and charlotte spending time together in all the weird places tokyo seems to incorporate. my rating: go and see it, you better hurry!
