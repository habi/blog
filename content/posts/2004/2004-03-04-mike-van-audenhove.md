last sunday my parents, my sister and me had a brunch in the [marzilibruggli](http://www.taberna.ch/) (where [nina](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/hn2.jpg) works). during the brunch the nose of my father started running (not that this is an event that needs to be blogged :-) and then a comicstrip from [mike van audenhove](http://www.zueritipp.ch/dyn/zuerichbymike/ssi/index.html) came to my mind.
zurich by mike is one of my favorite swiss comics, and luckily enough the [zuri-tipp](http://www.zueritipp.ch/dyn/index.html) - which publishes one strip per week - archives all the strips on its homepage.
so i skimmed through ALL of the strips there and finally found the strip that we talked about: 
[the nosedrop](http://www.zueritipp.ch/zuerichbymike/mike.php?woche=46&current=1&max=6).

all the strips depict the life in zurich, but could also happen elsewhere. i must say that mike van audenhove has a real talent to tell those little stories that make you smile.
all the strips are in german or swiss-german so the selection below is only funny for those capable of that funny language:
[some cheeky grannies](http://www.zueritipp.ch/zuerichbymike/mike.php?woche=5&current=1&max=9)
[hacky sacky rules](http://www.zueritipp.ch/zuerichbymike/mike.php?woche=21&current=1&max=9)
[messengers and traffic-lights](http://www.zueritipp.ch/zuerichbymike/mike.php?woche=39_03&current=1&max=5)
[kids having simple but true fun](http://www.zueritipp.ch/zuerichbymike/mike.php?woche=41&current=1&max=11)
[did you ever buy ikea furniture?](http://www.zueritipp.ch/zuerichbymike/mike.php?woche=07_02&current=1&max=3)
[kids playing frisbee](http://www.zueritipp.ch/zuerichbymike/mike.php?woche=14_02&current=1&max=8)
[winter biking](http://www.zueritipp.ch/zuerichbymike/mike.php?woche=48_03&current=1&max=8)
[sometimes i feel like this in the morning](http://www.zueritipp.ch/zuerichbymike/mike.php?woche=02_03&current=1&max=7)

bear with me if the windows that pop up are in a strange size, i could not get it right, because i had to "hack" the links, the zuritipp does not provide them in an easily bloggable format :-)
