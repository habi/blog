[urs gehrig reports](http://circle.ch/blog/p1453.html) that one of the mobile phone providers here in switzerland starts with an 5 bucks "all you can download"1 GPRS-plan. i've been looking forward for something like this for a long time (because everywhere else on the world there are a lot of flatrate GPRS-plans (just look at [phil torrones moblog ](http://pt.textamerica.com/)for instance, he uses it massively).
let's hope that this step starts the competition between the three mobile providers here in switzerland: [sunrise](http://mobile.sunrise.ch/home.htm) (my provider) and [orange](http://www.orange.ch/) and [swisscom](http://www.swisscom-mobile.ch/), i'd love to fill my [moblog](http://moblg.net/blog/habi) with unnecessary crap the whole day long!

oh, and did you notice the "latest moblog" in the sidebar? this is new and untested, but a nice little hint from piece saved me messing around with [mt-rssfeed](http://www.timaoutloud.org/code/mt/#mt-rssfeed) and other plugins for moveable type. i'll write a little (really little) documentation on this soon.

1 watch out! the "all you can download" plan only includes: 

<blockquote>[...] ausschliesslich das GPRS-Verbindungsvolumen, welches bei Rahmen der Benutzung der mobilen Portale von Swisscom Mobile anfallt. [...]</blockquote>

so no email-checking and "free" moblogging anytime, just a lot of downloads from the swisscom-portal (but i guess you could use your swisscom-portal-email for moblogging, so it's no big deal...
