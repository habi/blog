today i went down the river [aare](http://www.aaremarzili.info/) with sigi and some friends.
the picture below is colu, lukas and whatwashisname schrigy leading the pack of four boats, trying to catch those kayakers (i don't think they went [war kayaking](http://features.engadget.com/entry/5068632431817387/), the didn't look like that :-)
a pity the aare wasn't so warm like it could be in late june. nonetheless i swam from the eichholz to the marzili because i didn't want to walk down that approximately 2.5 km. not too bad for 15.7Â°, aight?
