while browsing [ipodlounge](http://gallery.ipodlounge.com/ipod/displayimage.php?album=4&pos=0)s new [photo-gallery](http://gallery.ipodlounge.com/) i found that [design for the iPod3](http://gallery.ipodlounge.com/ipod/displayimage.php?album=4&pos=0) which linked to an [amazing movie](http://66.216.122.95/_content/_reel/_movies/ispec.htm). it's a really fine piece of imagination and science-fiction (and quite big, but i couldn't get any information on the filesize).
you should definitely check it out!

and maybe you also should check out [kdlab.net](http://www.kdlab.net/) the page of the blokes that made that amazing movie ([their demo-reel](http://66.216.122.95/_content/_reel/_movies/large.htm) makes you want to be good at stuff like this!).
