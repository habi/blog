like always, all good things in life are free:
MTV has an upcoming show called [MTV Mash](http://www.mtvmash.com/). the french duo [Loo & Placido](http://loo-and-placido.audio-sault.com/) made all the bootlegs for that show.
the bootlegs that MTV turned down are now available from their L&D's site. if you don't want to sift through their page, the boingboing-post linked below has the direct links to all the mp3's. go and grab 'em. "Pound for Pound" and "Golden Bastard" are my favorites
