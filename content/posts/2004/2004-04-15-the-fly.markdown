instead of reading way too much rss-feeds and stuff on tha intaweb i instead watched  [the fly](https://imdb.com/title/tt0091064/) (the 1986 version, not [the original](http://imdb.com/title/tt0051622/) or [the upcoming remake](http://imdb.com/title/tt0379788/)).
not that it was a really good movie, but as an example of eighties trick-technique and scientific imagination and computer-trickery it was really enjoyable.
in the end it means that i now only have about 47 unwatched dvds in my [treasure chest](http://dict.leo.org/?search=schatztruhe) in the living room.
and to finish a busy day i'll now make an onion-[packing](http://dict.leo.org/?search=packing) to relieve my aching neck. i woke up with a really stiff neck [last monday morning](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000290.html) and it still doesn't feel better so nina suggested this remedy... (she's studying pharmaceutics, so actually onion-packings are not her thing, she's a bit more on the chemical side :-)
