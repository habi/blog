reading one of the latest editions of the [weltwoche](http://www.weltwoche.ch/artikel/?AssetID=7421&CategoryID=63) i stumbled over that funny little story.
[gorge dubya bush](http://homepage.mac.com/webmasterkai/kaicurry/gwbush/dishonestdubya.html) was holding a 45 min speech in orlando, florida. tyler crotty, some teenager, stood behind the big silly man and had to listen to him for the whole time. he couldn't help yawning, looking at his watch and twisting his head a bit to relieve the absolute boredom he encountered.
you have to watch the video to see how funny that is.
here's [the link to a video](http://www.local6.com/video/2968209/detail.html) of the best moments as a real-player file. if you don't have installed the real-player, then you can still check out the story on [local6-news](http://www.local6.com/news/2968435/detail.html) or take a look at [a slideshow](http://www.local6.com/slideshow/news/2967995/detail.html?qs=1&s=1&dm=ss&p=news) of the best moments.
hilarious!
