sigi... your phd sounds cool... (no pun intended) and speaking of snow I'm reading a really cool book at the moment called "high risk" (i think, not got the book handy... doh!) and it's about avalanches and Everest... really enjoyable page turner...

Speaking of PhD's snap.. I'm also doing one... total opposites... mines in astronautics... and in the sunny climes of Southampton, England...

Be good have fun...
