i'll be in vienna for the weekend (actually until monday evening).
nina [won some tickets](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000195.html), so we fly (and leave our eco-conscience at home) and thus we have four full days to enjoy [castle schonbrunn](http://www.schoenbrunn.at/) ([our hotel](http://lucia-hotel.at/) is near the castle), the [hofburg](http://www.hofburg-wien.at/), the [prater](http://www.wiener-prater.at/), the [stephans-dom](http://www.stephansdom.at/) and what else vienna has to offer.
and last but not least we'll meet babsi, a friend i met in '97 in australia (i can't believe it's such a long time) so i guess it's gonna be really funny!
have a nice weekend.
