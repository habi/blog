if you liked ["my" address book plugin](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000460.html), then you might dig [this script](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20041215134140510) posted on osxhints.com.
  
it enables you do do a quick google-lookup of any person in your address book, with a single click on the phonenumber of the desired person. (and can easily be adapted for other search engines, which might in the end enable me to throw together a "look-up-person-on-tel.search.ch-and-merge-info-with-already-in-addressbook"-script. but that's another story for another day.
  
good night.
