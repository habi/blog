last weekend i ran [the grand prix of bern](http://www.gpbern.ch/). i'm not really a big runner, nonetheless i managed to run the ten most beautiful miles on earth in a time of 1h, 9min and 27 seconds. not too bad for that my training consisted of going for a run three times prior to the race :-)

if you want to see how i've been doing after those 16.023 km, then you can [click here](http://www.finisherclip.de/events/bern_04/clip.php?bandbreite=220&nummer=4390&kameraposition=rechts#) and see my finish (courtesy of [finisherclip.de](http://www.finisherclip.de/)). i'm the guy in the pale blue shirt on the left finishing just seconds after the guy in the yellow tank-top and black shirt finishes. (and i love the woman shouting: "super schampu" afterwards :-)

here's another one: [nina](http://www.finisherclip.de/events/bern_04/clip.php?bandbreite=220&nummer=15022&kameraposition=rechts#), my darling finishes 27 minutes later (with 1:36:39) in the white jumper and green t-shirt on the right border of the clip.

the following two clips are from other messengers at work: [tom schwarz](http://www.finisherclip.de/events/bern_04/clip.php?bandbreite=220&nummer=14016&name=Schwarz%2C+Thomas&kameraposition=rechts) is the guy all in black with big hair manipulating his watch on the outermost right border finishing with 1:21:31.
and [florian and phippu](http://www.finisherclip.de/events/bern_04/clip.php?bandbreite=220&nummer=1405&name=Stuker%2C+Florian&kameraposition=rechts) manage to cross the finish-line practically simultaneous after 59min 45s. phippu is the one in the white tank-top congratulating floru in the blue shirt in the middle of the movie-clip.
congratulations to all of you!
