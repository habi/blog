this evening arlette called me.
arlette is [franziska's](http://www.foto-ff.com/) stylist, which helps her for the campaigns that franziska makes the pictures.
they are seeking some people for a campaign for [la redoute](http://www.laredoute.ch/redoutech/sBoutique) who stand around a tram while a girl in a bikini enters that tram (this is gonna be freezing, because at the moments it's [subzero conditions here](http://www.meteoschweiz.ch/de/Prognosen/Vorhersagen/IndexVorhersagen.shtml))
and if i can go, then i'll get me a new [ipod](https://apple.com/ipod/) from the money i get. mine starts to act strange and the guy at apple-store told me on the phone (after keeping me in the waiting line for 15 minutes...) that a repair costs 360.- (100 bucks less than a new ipod with three times the capacity). full stop.

ps: [the last time i modeled](https://habi.gna.ch/pics/CH-Fleisch/) i got me a [digital camera](https://google.com/search?q=dsc-p9&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) for the money, so this would just be a natural progression ...
