so if i link to chregels page with the keywords [jammerlicher waschlappen](http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/cf/br/112.html) i kinda induce some funk with googles index. this sounds like fun, count me in!

see the search-result on [this google-page](https://google.com/search?q=jaemmerlicher+waschlappen&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)

for our english-speaking audience: this is pretty much the same as when you google the term [miserable failure](https://google.com/search?q=miserable+failure&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) and reach the biography of dubja bush. chregel blocher is a member of the swiss federal council and quite a prick...
