this weekend i wanted to go [kiting](http://kitegenossen.ch/) with bruni. the problem was that the wind was really bad at the [bielersee](http://kitegenossen.ch/spots/bieler.htm). we hardly managed to keep the kite in the air (although it's a 12 squaremeter-thing) and thought it's no use to try it in the water. then we just couldn't find a suitable place at the [neuenburgersee](http://kitegenossen.ch/spots/neuenburgersee.htm) (i've been checking out kitegenossen just now :-( ) so the whole weekend was (kite-style) a big disappointment.
nonetheless i made a nice picture in neuchatel which you can see below.

i think we need to spend a weekend in [silvaplana](http://www.kitesailing.ch/) (bad bad website for OS Xers), where we both learned to kite-sail soon.
