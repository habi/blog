today i called [the insurance](http://www.alba.ch/) of the girl that hit me on [tuesday](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000249.html) and informed them that she did not hit a car, but destroyed a bike (they wrote: "please inform us, how expensive the repair of the motor vehicle is gonna be").
the guy on the phone was really friendly, but also a bit weird: "oh, i cannot believe that your bike (something like [this](http://www.kolumbus.fi/niko.koskela/asolo.jpg)) costed 2000 swiss francs five years ago, it must be something really expensive then". well, sure it was, it's one of my [work](https://velokurierbern.ch/)-horses, you silly! and when i informed him, that i'm also gonna buy a [new helmet](http://www.met-helmets.com/ProdottiDet.jsp?idrub=38&idcat=6#) on the insurance, he also a bit surprised. but hey, i don't wanna drive with a potentially damaged helmet, it's just not safe (not that it's safe in the first place :-)

and now comes the hard part. if the insurance is gonna pay me around 2k-bucks for a new bike i have to choose wisely, the choice is really big.

[thomu](http://www.thoemus.ch/) has [three](http://www.thoemus.ch/a_html/bikes/2004/sliker-team.htm) [really](http://www.thoemus.ch/a_html/bikes/2004/sliker-comp.htm) [nice](http://www.thoemus.ch/a_html/bikes/2004/twinner-street.htm) options.
[price bikes](http://www.price-bikes.ch/) has some of the [slickest looking frames](http://www.price-bikes.ch/bikes/road/overview.htm).
[roschu](http://bikeline.ch/) has [much more available](http://www.specialized.com/sbcSSRoadBikes.jsp?my=2004&JServSessionIdroot=fstwsq0d9s.j27002) and served me really well whenever i bought something there.
[our shop](http://velokurierladen.ch/01laden.html) has some very good deals on [bmc bikes](http://www.bmc-racing.com/bikes.cfm?lang=ger&catID=4) from last year.
or should i go for [pinarello](http://www.pinarello.com/main.php?surf=race&path=cycles%2Frace&lang=e) again?
decisions, decisions!

and why is the title of this entry new bike**s**?
today i went to the shop to get my other workbike (the one where i would be un-solaceable if it was damaged like the pinarello). the guys in the shop had to change pretty much everything except the frame :-)
i had to get two new rims, because the ones on the bike were paperthin, thus the also mounted new spokes and new brake pads. the main cause i brought the bike was that it needed a new set of chain rings because the ones on it served me well for about 8000 km, thus they also had to mount a new chain and new pinions (the cogwheels in the back). and because one of the shift-levers was broken, i told them to change that too. good that we have a decent rebate in the shop or else i would have paid much more than 577 bucks to get a literally new bike (all the major parts are brand-spanking new - exept the hubs, which were changed some months ago :-)
