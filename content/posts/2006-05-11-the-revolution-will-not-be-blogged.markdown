i might be possible that the revolution will happen and that you won't notice it, 'cause according to [this brilliant rant](http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=6942862&blogID=112034554), the revolution will not be blogged! (what a pity)


<blockquote>
The revolution will not have banners or popups or popunders
  
Or those irritating graphics that take over your whole screen.
  
You will not have to worry about having the latest Macromedia
  
Flash, Macromedia Shockwave or Macromedia Goddamn plugin.
  
The revolution will not work at all in Opera.
  
The revolution will not secretly hope for a deal with Microsoft.
  
The revolution will not be skinnable.
</blockquote>
