this is a fine piece of craftsmanship and also a good political statement, the [green hummer project](http://www.greenhummerproject.org/).


<blockquote>
This is the perfect SUV. Our SUV is healthy, friendly, non-polluting, simple, inexpensive, fun, and socially responsible. There are no black tinted windows to hide us from view. No air conditioning to further isolate us from the outside. No gas tank to fill and fill and fill. No greenhouse gasses pouring from the exhaust pipe. No frustration, no yelling, no honking, no road rage. No clocks to set, no alarm to annoy, no menus to scroll through. No video game system, DVD player, or GPS system.
</blockquote>


they even have a page with [videos](http://www.greenhummerproject.org/video/) you can browse through.
