is any of my readers interested to try out [joost](http://joost.com/)? it's the thing that was formerly called [the venice project](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=the+venice+project&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) and is a bit the same as [zattoo](http://zattoo.com/), but not enterly [1]. read more about joost in the last [wired here](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.02/trouble.html).

since i've signed up for betatesting joost quite a while ago, i've got 2 1 2 invitations **no more** invitations to spare. leave a comment below (with your email, i need it to send you the invitation, but i won't spam you...). first come, first serve!

[1]: i haven't had time to thorougly test it up to now, maybe i'm just not watching enough telly...
