have you ever thought that you need to start a blog, but you don't have access to a server (or friends who can spare some place)? then you should check out [freeflux.net](http://freeflux.net/), which just opened some days ago. check out the entry page to see the important things. the most important is on top: it's free :-)
  
and the other goodies are: based on the bitflux cms, open source, highly tweakable and supposedly fun.
