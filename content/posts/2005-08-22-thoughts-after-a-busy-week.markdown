- driving a [fixie](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/fixie/clusters/) with a huge backpack (clothes for week and some more stuff) through downtown basel and z√ºrich is not so fun
  
- going to the ecmc and not competing is only half the fun
  
- you need a valid passport or id to go to sweden (not me, mine is perfectly valid), but you can organize a passport in 30 minutes
  
- sleeping on a [boat](http://www.rygerfjord.se/) is fun
  
- sweden has the [biggest](http://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/34774857/) indoor swimming pools i've ever seen
  
- going to [another european championship](http://emc2005.se/) with 3700 contestants is massive fun
  
- the [ipod camera connector](http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=habignach-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.de/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00083PGFS%2526tag=habignach-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00083PGFS%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002) works like a charm (i took 260 pictures and some movies at the ecmc and at the emc)
  
- [hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/) will be runnig continuously for the next few days, cause i took a lot of panoramas
  
- i will tell you as soon as i uploaded the pictures, from time to time, you'll find a bunch on [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/)
