Why are you getting all worked up about fifty thousand people dying from an earthquake? **Every single day** 25,000 children [die from easily preventable diseases](http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:_MvpJLUvUuUJ:www.unicef.org/ffl/text/factsforlife-en.txt+Every+single+day+25,000+children+die+from+easily+preventable+diseases&hl=en). **Every single day** 24,000 people [die from hunger](http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/11/25/hunger031125). Do they not count?



Natural disasters happen. We can't prevent them, and ultimately they kill very few people. Hunger and disease problems in developing countries? That one is directly _our fault_. We literally created that catastrophe with our aggressive foreign policies, thus we ignore it. If you want to actually help the world, don't waste your money on Sri Lanka. Focus on curing poverty and stopping our first world governments from continually kicking down any nation that tries to climb out of that poverty.

read the text above again and step back a bit before flaming me or shannon! you must get the point. 
  
it's extremely sad for each and every person that had to die in south-east-asia or lost someone there. it's a terrible way of dying.
  
but do all the newspapers make an as big fuss as they do over the people that die of hunger in africa or anywhere else in the third world? **no, they dont**. that's my point. go and change the world where you can, don't change it where you cannot.
