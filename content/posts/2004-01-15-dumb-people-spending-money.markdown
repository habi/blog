i just cannot imagine how dumb people must be.
i saw this auction on [ricardo.ch](http://www.ricardo.ch/), where a guy sells his [firewire-drive enclosure](http://www.ricardo.ch/cgi-bin/auk?cmd=viewlot;lotid=308459130;) and thought, well 30 bucks seems like a fair price for it  (to make me an external hd, because my ibook comes to it's limit..).
and today i saw that some other guy set a higher bid, which is ok, that's the way it works. but then, one day later he sets another bid, so he actually wants to pay more than himself :-)
and then comes another guy and bids three times the last price, how dumb must you be to do that? (or maybe he is only very impulsive and couldn't think of another way to spend 95 bucks :-)
