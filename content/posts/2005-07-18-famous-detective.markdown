A man suspected his wife was seeing another man, so he hired the famous Chinese detective, Chen Lee, to watch and report any activities while he was gone. A few days later, he received this report:  



Most honorable Sir: 
  
You leave house. I watch house.
  
He come to house. I watch.
  
He and She leave house. I follow. He and She go in hotel. I climb tree.
  
I look in window.
  
He kiss She. She kiss He. He strip she. She strip He. He play with She. She play with He.
  
I play with me. I fall off tree.
  
I not see.



So no fee.



Chen Lee
