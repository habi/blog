[![1t](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/1t-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/1t.gif) the image on the left shows the total accesses of habi.gna.ch since the start in july last year (reminds me, i missed the anniversary :-). it impressed me that the total accesses to this little site are around 20000 a day which seems huge. but be reminded that every access to every file counts, so if you watch an index-page on the pics-section this counts as more than20 accesses (9 thumbnails, 2 navigation-buttons and 8 image files for the thumbnail frames plus the html-file itself plus the css-file).  

since the usage-statistics provided by gna.ch are not easily readable (e.g. something like [this](https://habi.gna.ch/usage/12330.html)) and i wanted to know a bit more about you i implemented a little counter in the sidebar (under the "test" category).
the counter provided by [countnow.de](http://www.countnow.de) adds a human touch to all the data that can be pulled from your visit. i will keep it in the test-category to see if i am pleased with it or until you, my dear readers get bored with it. if you click on the number you will get teleported to the counter-page which is free for everyone to abuse...

since i saw that [baba](http://barbaraboehler.twoday.net/) had this counter on her travel-blog i felt like beamed back to my first web page when it was cool to have a counter on your page, which was populated mostly by your hits. and this made me do it, the whole stuff above is solely justification-babble...
