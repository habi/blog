[susi](https://habi.gna.ch/pics/Millau/Pages/57.html) sent me some pictures which she made in [millau](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000046.html)
it shows me on the start to 200m crawl:

if you watch closely on the second image, then you can see that i'm quite a bit ahead of the other starters in my heat (i'm the one on the second lane from left).
but the referee still thought it's a valid start, so i had an advantage :-) nonetheless i came in [pretty much as last](http://www.ffnatation.org/webffn/mtr/xx_live_nag.php?idcpt=567&idlng=gbr&idclb=SKBE%20BERN) :-)
