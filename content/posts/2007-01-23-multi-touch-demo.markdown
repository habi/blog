i've written about jeff han [already](http://habi.gna.ch/2006/08/29/the-future-of-interfaces/), now i've stumbled over a new demo of the multi-touch-gui he and his colleagues are developing (they've been contacted by apple for the iphone-gui, but are not involved with it).
watch the video below and be amazed (close your mouth, or you'll drool over your keyboard...)
