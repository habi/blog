i has got me a [new mobile phone](http://images.google.com/images?q=k610i&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). it is supposed to be able to do video calls via UMTS. the person in the sunrise-shop that sold me the phone told me that it is possible to make videocalls between all the swiss providers, but contrary to that it doesn't work. i know three people with an UMTS-video-enabled mobile phone, and none of them is provided by sunrise.
any of my readers want to ring me up, so i can try a video call? my number can be found on [tel.search.ch](http://tel.search.ch/). just search for my surname (haberth√ºr) and the profession "rockstar" (really!) and give me a ring, so we can try seeing each other!
