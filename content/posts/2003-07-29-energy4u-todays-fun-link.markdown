while i had a break today at [work](http://www.velokurierbern.ch) (it's summer holidays here, so a lot of our clients do not work thus we sometimes get a break...) a guy came chatting me up.
this bloke started to talk about crop-cirlces and pyramid-energy (where razorblades get sharp again when put under a small pyramid) and stuff like that. then he gave me this piece of paper with lots of links on it. one of these links was [energy4u](http://www.energy4u.de) (sorry, only in german).

i just had to post [this link](http://www.energy4u.de/beamer.htm) as the fun link of today, go check it out!
(they also have a really funky [disclaimer](http://www.energy4u.de/disclaimer.htm) where they write that their products can also have NO effect, how pathetic...)
