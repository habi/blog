[![Almajane](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/almajane-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/almajane.jpg)until some hours ago i believed that maybe i made the first ever underwater panorama photograph, while on the philippines. a simple google search proved me wrong, there is already much more impressive work available online (see [here](http://www.panoramas.dk/tulamben.html), for the first ever published underwater panorama [1]). nonetheless i'm gonna tell you the story of the panorama of my alma jane shot in this post.



while we resurfaced from the [alma jane](http://www.cdnn.info/industry/i030304a/i030304a.html) i shot 7 images of the wreck and then tried to reconnect them later on with the excellent [hugin for osx](http://homepage.mac.com/ippei_ukai/software/). as i mentioned before i started to use [makecubic](http://developer.apple.com/quicktime/quicktimeintro/tools/) from apple to convert the .tiff-files from hugin to quicktime vr .mov files which are sometimes more pleasant to view.



this particular panorama was the first for me to notice something special:



[![Almajane1](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/almajane1-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/almajane1.jpg)when i generated the panorama the resulting image was much more pleasing when i added a horizontal guideline along the railing of the ship. this resulted in the image seen on the top left. when i didn't add that guideline the resulting image was not so pleasing to the eye, mostly because the ship looks really crooked, as seen on the bottom right.



so i uploaded the uncrooked version to [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/48386093/), for all of you to see. then i converted the images with makecubic, 'cause i wanted to see how the panoramas look when converted to a quicktime vr. that's when the difference comes in. the first, uncrooked version looks a bit weird when viewing as a qtvr as you can see in the movie on the left below (760 kb .mov-file).[

[![Mov Almajane-1](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/mov_almajane-1-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/mov_almajane-1.mov)[![Mov Almajane1](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/mov_almajane1-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/mov_almajane1.mov)



the second image looks much more like it was in the water, where the movement was a swaying from left to down to right. see for yourself in the movie on the left (769 kb .mov-file).
  
just so you can see what bonds me to my computer on those long, lazy and rainy sunday afternoons.
  
have a good week!
