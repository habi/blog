[boingboing](http://boingboing.net/2004_02_01_archive.html#107599095077075633) points out a really weird fact: at [itunes' music-store](http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/) (how do you write that frigging thing? i'll just stick to ITMS!) you can get songs which consist of nothing than silence. how funny is that: buy silence for 99 cents a pop and buy it with some proper [DRM](http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&Acronym=drm&Find=Find)-scheme!

so, if you live in the us of a, you can get [6 minutes and 45 seconds](http://www.appleturns.com/scene/?id=4490) (the full playlist at appleturns) of silence for just $8.91. this is really cheap, go and get it, while it's fresh!

but watch out, some songs are labelled:[![](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/parental-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/parental.gif) (which i have to admit, is a bit hard to get..)

oh, and you can even buy [15 minutes of silence](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=4340413&selectedItemId=4340407)! (but only if you buy the full album)
(the link above and most of the links on appleturns will only work if you got [itunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) on yer box.)
