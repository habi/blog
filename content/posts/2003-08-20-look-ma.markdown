how do you like my new dock?

[![](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/lawn-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/lawn.jpg)

a funny little app named [skin a dock](http://ittpoi.com/stem.php?product=com.ittpoi.skinadock&type=frameset) makes this possible. and it's even donationware, so double the fun :-) 
SaD needs the [application enhancer ](http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/ape/)from [unsanity](http://www.unsanity.com/) (go check them out, they have a bunch of cool OS X apps) to run, but it takes care of downloading it, so you only need to download skinadock, the rest is a walkthrough...
