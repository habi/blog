you got an [mms-enables mobile phone](http://mobile.sunrise.ch/mms.htm)?
want to send a real postcard to someone who doesn't have one of these gizmos?
then [click here](http://vas1.rixxo.biz/spc/index_de.html) and follow the instructions :-)

this is a new service from the [swiss post](https://spc.swisspostnet.com/global/home.jsp) ([press release](http://www.swisspost.com/SiteOnLine/EN/Accueil/1,1727,15340,00.html)). they will print a postcard for you and send it.
the funny thing is, that the first one is free, so give it a go, you only have to pay one mms and a marginal data-amount...
really retro. send a truly digital message and someone gets a truly offline postcard.
silly it costs 3 bucks when you use it more than once...
