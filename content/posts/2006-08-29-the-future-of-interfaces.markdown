[jeff han](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~jhan/) [1] is a researcher at the new york university. he gave a [talk](http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=j_han) at the [ted-conference](http://www.ted.com/). if you're a bit interested in the - possible - future of interface design, you have to watch the ~9 minute-long video below. it nearly blew my socks of, when i imagined how i could swipe through my 7000+ images on my hd like that. handling of big chunks of date seems to be really fun with that kind of interface.







and i also found mr. han quite entertaining. he has to talk really fast to get all the ideas and thoughts out quick enough, or his [brain is gonna explode](http://pieceoplastic.com/index.php/2525/ruff-linkage-200634/) (pun intended...)



[1] bummer: while searching for his homepage, i found out, that i've already [blogged him](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000730.html) with with the same project... yeah well, talk about short attention span. but if you want, you can watch some other talks [here](http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/).
