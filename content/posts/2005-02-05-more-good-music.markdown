this day seems to be musical: the kleptones have released another mashup album: [From Detroit To J.A](http://www.kleptones.com/pages/downloads_fd2ja.html). i haven't had time to listen to all the tracks up to now, but if it's only half as brilliant as [A Night At The Hip-Hopera](ptones.com/pages/downloads_hiphopera.html), then it's mighty good. the mixalbum is only available as torrent. either as [one big mp3 with cue file](http://www.kleptones.com/pages/The%20Kleptones%20-%20From%20Detroit%20To%20J.A.%20(burn%20version).torrent) or [as individual mp3s](http://www.kleptones.com/pages/The%20Kleptones%20-%20From%20Detroit%20To%20J.A.%20(split%20version).torrent) (83.3mb).
