is this a known problem for other iphone-owning readers of my blog?  

iTunes tells me that there are updates for iPhone applications, I click on the "check for updates"-button and iTunes tells me - sometimes twice - that updates for my programs are available. i thus have to click multiple times to see the updates of which I already know that they're available... quite annoying, don't you think? does one of my readers have the same problem and even knows a resolution? I'd like to hear your tips.  

a short screencast describing the problem can be seen below:
