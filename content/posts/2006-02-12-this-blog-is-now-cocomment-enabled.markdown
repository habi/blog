after [reading](http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2006/02/06/how-will-cocomment-change-our-commenting-habits/) a lot of [buzz](http://technorati.com/chart/tag:cocomment) about [cocomment](http://www.cocomment.com/) (explained a [wee bit here](http://www.cocomment.com/teamblog/?p=25) :-) i thought it's about time to jump the bandwagon. 
  
and now, after adding [a little bit of code](http://www.cocomment.com/teamblog/?p=21) to the individual entry archive this blog is now officially pimped -ehrm- cocomment enabled.
  
have no idea what i'm talking about? i only start to get the implication of cocomment, but let me explain it here, as far as i get it: up to now, whenever i commented on a blog/site somewhere, i had to remember to visit the site later on or add the comment feed to my [feedreader](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) to not loose that particular conversation string. cocomment should be able to overcome that, because it enables a lot of sites (even [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/35034363287@N01/95437797/#comment25173650)!) to "send" the comments back to one central location. i'm now able to track those comments in a central location and follow conversations more, thus participating more (talk about [positive feedback](http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2006/02/05/visibility-is-in-feedback-loops/) loop).



so, if you want to see in which conversations i take part or want to stalk me you should look [here](http://www.cocomment.com/comments/habi) or add [this feed](http://www.cocomment.com/rss2/habi.rss) to your preferred feed-reader.



but now it's officially too late, so i wish you all a good night!
