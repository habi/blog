yesterday there was a [flash mob](http://www.google.com/search?q=flash+mob&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) here in [bern](http://jukebox.radiox.ch:8080/spot/stories/301/) (and i missed it, i thought it's today, i confused the date...)
and today there was a little article in two newspapers (in the [BZ](http://www.espace.ch/medien/archiv/details.asp?newspaper=bz&vID=343004) and in [20min](http://www.20min.ch/news/bern/story/8698870)).
[b.](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/) and me were thinking about "organising" a flash mob some weeks ago. he pointed out a link to me about the [first flashmob in manhattan](http://www.cheesebikini.com/blog/archives/000261.html). (actually we talked about it on the 18th of june, because i was just looking up the conversation we had over ICQ...) and it [seemed like a really funny](http://www.cheesebikini.com/archives/000271.html) thing to do. as [berni points out,](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/archives/000055.html) the flash mob in bern was not a full success, but i think this leaves room for more ideas...
