i have to admit, that i slowly start to get the whole thing behind [FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/), mostly because i started my journey through the foaf-space againg after reading [B.'s post](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/archives/000079.html). 
and i can say that [plink](http://beta.plink.org/) (here's [my plink-page](http://beta.plink.org/profile.php?id=27562b13aed47f8565fff5bf2e3bcd83fe328c0f)) is a good approach to it, i prefer it to the approach of the [foaf-explorer](http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/), which makes it look a bit complicated and forces you to enter a foaf-file instead of just searching for names.

so, if you want to [add](http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/new/?foaf=http://habi.gna.ch/foaf.rdf) me to your friend-space, then here's my [foaf-file](http://habi.gna.ch/foaf.rdf) (it's been there since a while if you haven't noticed...).

**btw**: if you don't want to code a foaf.rdf yourself, then [foaf-matic](http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html) helps you with the start. so we can populate that space of friends a bit...
