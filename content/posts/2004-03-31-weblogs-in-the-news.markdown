[nick luthi](http://www.bernergazette.ch/archives/000251.html) (one of the bloggers over at the [berner gazette](http://www.bernergazette.ch/)) wrote [a nice article](http://www.ebund.ch/artikel_11603.html) about weblogs in (one of) [the local newspaper](http://www.ebund.ch/)s.
he nicely explains terms like blogosphere and points out some hints on how to start your own weblog.
give it a read!

**ps**: if you don't have a hard-copy of todays bund, go and read [the article](http://www.ebund.ch/artikel_11603.html) now, i don't know how long it will be freely available in the [eBund](http://www.ebund.ch/), i suspect that in a week you've got to pay for the access. oh, and by the way, the article is in german.
