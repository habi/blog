ok, i thought it's about time to jump the bandwagon and list some friends with a blog:




	
  * [Barni](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch), an old classmate and also a mate at university ([Which](http://ubecx01.unibe.ch:8081/)seems farther away from day to day...). He "seduced" me to install a movable type blog here on habi.gna.ch (actually he installed it for me:-)  

Barni is the CTO of [[search.ch]](http://www.search.ch/) and has an unbelievable insight into the inner workings of any computer and programming language

	
  * [Miklos](http://www.kozary.com/mt), also an old classmate of mine, and a good friend through all those long DVD-Nights :-)  

He is the chief of [the steadicenter](http://www.steadicenter.com/) and one of the web-masters of [golfplayer.ch](http://www.golfplayer.ch/). The [other one](http://armand.bild.li/17/view.html) has no blog (yet).


  * Barnis Brother [Arni](http://www.arnoldseefeld.com/blog/) just started a blog too.  

He's a very good drummer, but does actually [sell](http://www.arnoldseefeld.com/drum/) his whole equipement (perhaps to make some money for his upcoming trip to the remote parts of our world :-)
