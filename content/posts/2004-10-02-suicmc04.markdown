here's the flyer to the suicmc04 here in bern.
if all goes well, the flyer should be in the [20minuten](http://www.20min.ch/) tomorrow. and if you're a listener to [radiobe1](http://www.radiobe1.ch/), then you might be able to catch the ad they're airing for us (or you can just [click here](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/Spot_SUICMC04.mp3) and listen to the spot online (543kb .mp3-file) :-)

for more info go to [suicmc04.ch](http://suicmc04.ch/)

and if you're looking at a search on my preferred telephone-number-finder [tel.search.ch](http://tel.search.ch/), then you might be able to spot a banner which links to the suicmc04 homepage (thanks to [b.](http://bernhardseefeld.ch/) and [RIM](http://www.search.ch/rim.html))

**almost forgot to tell!** there's also a [critical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass) [mass](http://www.critical-mass.org/) which is more than open for anyone! so take your bikes if you come and give us a visit.
