if you see some freaks on bikes driving around bern like mad on friday night, then you know it's an alleycat1 organised by bene and me :-)
so, if you see one of the messengers (sometimes after 10pm) then cheer and shout and watch your back for more reckless drivers!

1 Alleycat: not on a closed course held race in a city, organized by bikemessengers. Usually with several checkpoints and not caring about traffic rules. As far as known, the first alleycats known as such took place in toronto, Canada.
