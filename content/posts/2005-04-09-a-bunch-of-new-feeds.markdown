i just returned from the [matt blogg+birthday meet](http://blog.ch/blog/index.php/archives/2005/03/29/the-matt-blogbirthday-meet/) which was really nice and interesting. it was really nice connecting the faces to the bits and bites, talking about tagging vs. keywords, map orientations and stuff like that. 
  
i actually suspected to stay around an hour or so, but in the end i turned out to be home around ten at night. 
  
guys and gals, it was really interesting to meet all of you, and i'm surely gonna add some more feeds to my news-reader.



btw: if you want to see the appropriate images, then go to my [blog.ch-meet-tag](https://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/blogchmeet/) on flickr. (so please tag your images accordingly, so they show up as a whole bunch under [the general tag blog.ch-meet](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/blogchmeet/).
