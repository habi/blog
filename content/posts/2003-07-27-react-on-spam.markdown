The [Sonntagszeitung](http://www.sonntagszeitung.ch/) (the sunday paper here in Switzerland) of today had a [funny article](http://www.sonntagszeitung.ch/dyn/news/multimedia/295019.html) on the SPAM i get quite a lot lately... 
  

You might know it, it's one of these mails where it goes along those lines:  




_[snip]  

I am Mr. Jeff Obed, Provincial Manager  DBSA Bank of South Africa, 
Capetown, Branch.  

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for 
you.  

On June 6, 1999, a foreign mining consultant/contractor with the South 
Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) 
Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve million, 
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a 
routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply._
