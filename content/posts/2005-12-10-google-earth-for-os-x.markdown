[![Googleearthnapf](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/googleearthnapf-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/googleearthnapf.jpg)yesterday i read on [fscklog.com](http://www.fscklog.com/2005/12/screenshot_von_.html), that there's a leaked version of [google earth](http://earth.google.com/) for os x in the wild. and today [the uaw](http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/09/google-earth-os-x-beta-leaked/) posted a link to [macupdate.com](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/20124), where you can download an unofficial beta release of the program. it works nicely on my mac, but your mileage may vary, and keep in mind that this is not an official release, so it might contain stuff you don't want, i've warned you...
  
it worked for me, but may not for you. the faint of heart just wait 'till google officially releases it.



the image on the left shows a screenshot with some nice clouds scattered around the [napf-gebiet](http://www.schweizerseiten.ch/napfgebiet.htm).
