![battery](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/battery.jpg)yesterday evening my ibook crashed. it locked up when i started realplayer to listen to some late-nite tunes while having [setiathome](http://setiathome2.ssl.berkeley.edu/fcgi-bin/fcgi?email=david.haberthuer%40gmx.ch&cmd=user_stats_new) running (so the processor was on full duty).
normally such lock-ups are not a big deal, it will recover from itself, i thought, just give it some time. i thought, maybe if i unplug it, it will go to sleep soon and be a happy puppy again. so i lay on my bed and started to read in [my book](http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/kaiserreich/kunst/unrat/). sometimes later i must have fallen asleep without actually looking how my ibook is doing.
this morning the ibook was sitting happily on my desk, turned off. it did not go to sleep, which is what it normally does when the battery power is too low, but was turned off. so the battery must have been completely drained. no big deal, it only lasted 5-6 minutes anyway, because my ibook is about three years old, and was used a lot on it's own juice.
the amazing part is that when i rebooted, i saw that the battery icon mentioned that the battery needs about two and a half hours to fully charge again. hmm. that's much much more than it ever said before. then after these two and a half hours i unplugged the ibook from the juice and the icon says: (after some "calculating...") that i got an hour and 16 minutes left on battery power. amazing.
i guess the battery was not so bad then. lucky i'm not the winning bidder [here](http://www.ricardo.ch/cgi-bin/auk?cmd=viewlot;lotid=319121174) :-)

i think the full draining of the battery must have [reset the PMU](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=14449), something i've read about a long time ago, when i wanted to rejuvenate the battery with some full load and drain cycles. amazing what a little really complete drain of the battery can do.
i feel like i've got a new ibook :-)
