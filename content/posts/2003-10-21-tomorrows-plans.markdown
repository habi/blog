tomorrow i give two double lessons:
in the first i'll make an introduction to electrostatics, with use of the [ van der graaf-generator](http://www.amasci.com/emotor/vdg.html), it's one of the "reallyreally-fun-experiments" in physics....
in the second i have an exam with the class (and i'm more nervous than they are, because it's my first exam as a teacher, i spent 10 hours (no joke) editing it!) 
i'll post [some more](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000095.html) tomorrow (or actually today, because it's sleepytime already!)
