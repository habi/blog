I'm absolutely stunned by this talk by [Stephen Fry](http://www.stephenfry.com/) in which he dismantles pretty much everything about the catholic church. The politeness in his words and extremely well phrased arguments makes it an amazing talk to watch. I really recommend listening to the whole video, even if you don't understand everything. If you want to skip it, then skip to minute 16 where Mr. Fry [lambasts](http://www.dict.cc/?s=lambast) the stance of the catholic church regarding its policies about sex.  


  
  
  
  
  

One of the [links](http://tywkiwdbi.blogspot.com/2010/02/stephen-fry-speaks-about-catholicism.html) I've got this presentation through words it so well, that I'm citing:  



<blockquote>
  It's a powerful presentation, and depending on your own beliefs, you will know whether you want to hear this talk or not.
</blockquote>




If Mr. Fry is speaking too fast for you, [a mind at play](http://www.amindatplay.eu/) offers a [transcript of the (whole) debate](http://) to read in your own pace.
