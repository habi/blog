today my cheapo headphone was killed in an accident (it fell out my bag while i was on the bike and the cord was ripped off, no big deal, it only costed 9.90 a year ago.)
so i thought it's about time to get a real headphone:
[![](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/koss-porta-pro-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/koss-porta-pro.jpg) i went to [eschenmoser](http://www.eschenmoser.ch/) (my favourite discounter here in bern) and after trying out all the headphone they had on diplay there (ok, i did not really think about getting [a headphone for 590 swiss francs](http://www.sennheiser.com/sennheiser/icm.nsf/root/produkte_kopfhoerer_zuhause_stereoanlage)) i bought the [koss](http://www.koss.com) portapro (pictured left) for 99 CHF. 
This sounds quite expensive, but i have to say it was the best headphone i listened to, the quality in the shop was really impressive.
the moment i came out of the shop i started to realize that i bought the real thing . when i plugged the koss into my ipod i knew i was missing something since the moment i bought those cheap headphones i used since a year or so. the sound-quality is at least ten times better :-) 

i have to say that i'm never ever gonna buy cheap headphones, sometimes it's better to spend some more dough. (not that i need to ever buy another headphone, because the portapro comes with a lifetime warranty...)

and now i come home, and want to blog it and find out that the [portapro](http://www.uhu.ch/set.htm?/deutsch/kopfhoerer/koss.htm) is [unbeatable](https://www.k55.ch/shop/single_article.php3?nArtikel_ID=38&VID=2uOwQiT1AhD42ldx) in his class and has been rated the best headphone in different tests. how cool :-)
