well, here i am again, after quite a bunch of skiing

a whole week on the [hungerberg](http://www.hungerberg.ch/) with the class i mentioned below. it was absolutely amazing, on wednesday we had fresh snowfall and we were able to ski in knee-deep powder (some pics might come soon)
a exhausting day with sigi in [nendaz/verbier](http://www.televerbier.ch/index.cfm?dsp_pagebody=../map/page&dsp_pagetop=skiboard&dsp_image=skiboard&dsp_fla=domaine&lng=en) which was amazing and fulfilled with lots of off-pist skiing in an amazingly big ski-resort.
and another day on the [bettmeralp](http://www.bettmeralp.ch/e/) with my parents, which was really nice, in total a week and a half with the most beautiful weather one can imagine (yes, a day with heavy snowfall is beautiful weather if you're skiing!)
now i come home and the weather is blah like in deep november. i think i'll go skiing soon :-)

my room is still a mess, because i've been so busy the last ten hours i've been home, that i couldn't start de-messing it. hope i find some time tomorrow, now i go and cuddle with nina.
