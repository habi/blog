oh, and just a quick note: the comments are down for some mysterious reason. i'm on it.



thanks [sigi](http://skooba.com/) for noticing (oh, and what happened to your content?)



[![Tinyturing](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/tinyturing-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/tinyturing.jpg)**update**: the comments-script nearly took down existenz.gna.ch (again), so someone chmodded it to 000.  i'm nearly ready to switch to [wordpress](http://wordpress.org/), if this goes on, i don't want to stress the server that much [1]. for the moment i implemented the [tinyturing-test](http://www.staggernation.com/mtplugins/TinyTuring/) from [staggernation](http://www.staggernation.com/). so all commenters must now enter a random letter into the field when they want to post a comment, as seen in the image on the right.



i personally hate that kind of test (also captchas!), but it seems, it's necessary to take some strain away from the server...



[1]: as far as i understood, wp is much easier on the resources it uses from the server...
