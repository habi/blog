there's been cooking something for [quite a long time](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000575.html), now everything seems to be going along really fine.
  
[jan](https://pieceoplastic.com/), [nick](http://bernergazette.ch/), [matthias](http://blog.ch/) and [urs](http://circle.ch/) [1] fixed a date and set up a [website/blog](http://swissblogawards.ch/) for it, so more infos will come along soon i guess!



if you'd like to add it to your calendar, then you can go here, i put it on [upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/event/40712/).

[1] they even set up a postcheque-konto, so nothing can go wrong :-) (if you can do that, then you can do everything!)
