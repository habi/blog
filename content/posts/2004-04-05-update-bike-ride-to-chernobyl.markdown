as diggory says, the [photo diary of a motorcycle tour](http://www.angelfire.com/extreme4/kiddofspeed/) is one of the most frightening and depressing things i've seen in a long while!

**update:** [boingboing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/05/26/girl_photoblogs_cher.html) notes that this story probably is some kind of hoax. nonetheless the whole story behind the story is unbelievably sad and should never ever happen again. nowhere!
