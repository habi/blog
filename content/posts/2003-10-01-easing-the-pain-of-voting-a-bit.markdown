[Smartvote](http://www.smartvote.ch/)1 seems like a good approach to the [upcoming parliament elections](http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/nrw03/) here in [switzerland](http://ch.ch/) because it helps you narrow down your possible candidates to elect.
the user (probably you) has to answer either 24 or 70 questions (dubbed smartvote [rapide](http://www.smartvote.ch/de/sv-user-doanswer-rapide.html) or [deluxe](http://www.smartvote.ch/de/sv-user-doanswer.html)) about actual political problems and decide how he/she would decide. 
then smartvote matches your "political profile" to all the candidates in it's database which also filled out that questionnaire. 
this makes the process of voting a bit less painful, or at least a bit more accurate, because up to now i couldn't be bothered to actually look up all the candidates i wanted to elect. i just dropped down the list of the [political](http://www.spschweiz.ch/index.htm) [parties](http://www.gruene.ch/) i support... (which get a 72.4% and 74.5% compliance with my answers...)
and amazingly enough, [Ursula  Wenger-Kupferschmied](http://www.smartvote.ch/de/portraet-portraet-overview---616--0.html) (with quite a kooky smile) from the [evangelic party](http://www.evppev.ch/) has the highest accordance (77.6%) with my ideas :-)
talk about politically uninterested geeks :-)
1(which does not work at the [moment](http://www.humanclock.com/clock.php)  but did this morning...)

update: the site is working again, so that i could generate my [political profile](http://cheese.geo.unizh.ch/hermann-bin/smartspider.pl?350&7CA1C5&79&76&52&32&5&95&77&93)...
