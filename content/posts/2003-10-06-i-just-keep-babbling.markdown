today [Renzo](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/SUICMC03/Pages/25.html) gave me his [MemoryStick](http://www.memorystick.com/en/) with the pictures he made in luzern this saturday (he owns exactly the same camera a I do, funnily enough).
and there were quite some cool pictures of me on it, i especially like these:
