if you're interested how it feels to get a massive tattoo on the back, then [Keith's](http://www.nootrope.net/) [Koi-blog](http://www.nootrope.net/koi/index.html) is for you to read. Funnily enough i found this on [boingboing](http://boingboing.net/2003_10_01_archive.html#106641155922478162) and some days ago i talked to [him](http://iam.bmezine.com/?nootrope) on [IAM](http://iam.bmezine.com/) :-)

and related to other [news](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000092.html), nina is now officially in zurich. we spent a really nice day together, went for a long walk and had one of the feared [nemesis](http://imdb.com/title/tt0208092/quotes)-cakes in the restaurant ma [marzilibrucke](http://www.taberna.ch/), where she also works. 
but this perfect day with her does lead to me having a sunday evening blues, which is not too bad, because i still need to finish the lessons i hold tomorrow morning, so this keep my mind off blue thoughts.
