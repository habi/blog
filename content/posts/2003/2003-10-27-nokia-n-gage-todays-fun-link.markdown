[this](http://www.sidetalkin.com/) is why the new [nokia n-gage gameconsolemobilephonetacoshell](http://www.n-gage.com/R1/en/home.html) is never gonna be a hit!

**update**: it might not be obvious, but nokias designers do not read [books on industrial design](https://amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/007229647X/qid=1067363198/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/103-2754978-8342202?v=glance&s=books). this means, that the user has to [hold the n-gage sideways](http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:wbRKPvx2-lIJ:www.usatoday.com/tech/techreviews/products/2003-10-23-ngage_x.htm+talk+sideways+n-gage&hl=de&ie=UTF-8) to make a phone-call with it. how daft is that?

**update**: see what [gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/009756.php) has to say to bad industrial design :-) (actually not really about the n-gage, but about the new nokia 7700 which is sidetalking-enabled, too...)
