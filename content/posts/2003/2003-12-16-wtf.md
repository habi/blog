or have you ever seen a police-car with an USB-hub to plug in that USB-powered-police strobe?

[via [slashdot](http://ask.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=80862&cid=7119499)] and following up [these posts](https://habi.gna.ch/?s=usb-powered) :-)

oh, and the [usb-grill](http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/looflirpa/igrill.shtml) (aprils fool joke) or [usb-razor](http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/akiba/hotline/20030419/image/nusbs1.html) (which reminds me of [that mobile](http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=www.mobile-review.com/review/image/motorola/v70/pic3.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2002/siemvsmot-en.shtml&h=276&w=500&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dmotorola%26start%3D40%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Dde%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26sa%3DN)) are not bad, too.
