When i get an SMS on [my mobile phone](http://www.sonyericsson.com/t610/index.htm?overview/index.htm) while it's paired over bluetooth to my trusty little [ibook](https://apple.com/ibook/) i get a window like this:

this is just too frigging nifty!  

(for those without german.....  

**BOAH: this is even cooler!**  

while i was typing this entry, [Gabu Palacios](https://habi.gna.ch/pics/GeburiGaebu/Pages/15.html) (on the left, getting the score while I play Gabu-Pong) called me, and voila I get this window!

Does any PC offer the same functionality (Call me a [proselyted](http://dict.leo.org/?p=5qvU.&search=proselyte) Switcher)  

OK, here's the translation for those of you non-german-readers:  






  * The first window is titled "incoming SMS" and the buttons offer the ability to save the SMS as a note, answer or aknowledge with ok (duh!)


  * The second window is titled "incoming call and says that the phone rang four times. I'm offered to answer via SMS, to direct Gabu to my voice mail or to get the call.






PS: Thank God i know the Keyboard-Shortcuts for a Screenshot by heart (Apple+Shift+3 for the whole screen and Apple+Shift+4 for a selection) :-)



and i almost forgot: The incoming call does also mute my ibook and unmute it when i hang up...
