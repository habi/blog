The [Egger Bier](http://www.eggerbier.ch/) Brewery has a funky little [Organigramm](http://www.eggerbier.ch/images+text/Mitarbeiter/organigramm.htm) on their page.  

The only fun part about this is, that this Brewery has a dedicated[Horse Team](http://www.eggerbier.ch/images+text/Mitarbeiter/pferdeneu.htm) with three a nice gal and some cool boys.  


oh, and [filewile.com](http://filewile.com/filewile.php) has just uploaded a new track (Cosmic Curry) yesterday night...





I'm listening to Bodhisattva Vow from the album The Sounds Of Science (Disc 1) by [Beastie Boys](https://google.com/search?q=%22Beastie Boys%22) while typing this entry.
