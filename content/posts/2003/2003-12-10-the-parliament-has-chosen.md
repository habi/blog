holy shite!
this time i really need to think about moving to another county!
the parliament renewed the [federal council ](http://www.bernergazette.ch/archives/000069.html) this morning. 
and guess what: they chose to substitute a [ruth metzler ](http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/cf/br/108.html)with the (too far) right-wing blocker [chregel blocher](http://www.blocherisacunt.ch.vu/).
as much as i do not really like miss metzler it's quite sad that we now have [a new council](http://www.espace.ch/dossiers/artikel/39422/artikel.html) that is [too far on the right wing ](http://plasticcam.textamerica.com/?r=225034)of the political spectrum and has a woman less than before (not that 2 out of 7 was a real representation of the 51% women in switzerland...)
