today i went shopping a little bit (free afternoon, because all my classes are already on holidays and i'm only biking around 50 % of my time...): some little stuff for the upcoming week, i'll be in [greece](http://www.wunderground.com/global/stations/16742.html), and then went to [jaggi](http://www.jaeggi.ch/index_home.php), because you can read all the comics you want without bein bothered.  

near the comics [FUST](http://shop.fust.ch/fust/default.asp) has an electronica-shop which i never can resist and always go and have a little look: today i spotted the perfect replacement for my old VCR, which is not far away from dying: the [Panasonic DMR-HS2 ](http://www.edgereview.com/ataglance.cfm?category=Video&ID=359), a combination of HD- and DVD-recorder which can fit up to 52 hours of video on its disk.  


then i was looking things up a little bit and found out, that there are some other rivals of the DMR-HS2:





  * first, the [DMR-E80S](http://www.federalstereo.com/dvdrewibuin8.html), also from Panasonic which _"Replaces the DMR -HS2 and also adds MP3 Playback and doubles the recording time by having an 80GB hard drive."_ and funkyly costs 300$ less (according to [froogle.google.com](http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=DMR-HS2&btnG=Froogle+Search&scoring=p))



  * then the [TVS 100](http://www.tv-server.de/content/tv-server/tvs100.htm) from Fast, which has no recorder, but a [network option](http://www.tv-server.de/content/tv-server/n-option.htm), so you can FTP your recorded series to your Mac or PC to burn it to  VCD, SVCD or DVD.  
Its [bigger brother](http://www.tv-server.de/content/tv-server/tvs200.htm) can even be programmed over the web.


  * the computec dm-d100, sitting on the same shelf at FUST (with no avaliable info on google :-) which is cheaper (1000 CHF as opposed to the 1500 CHF one has to pay for the DMR-HS2) but has no recording nor networking ability. it sports a 120 Gb-HD and seems very plasticky, but hey, who needs archiving :-)


so we get to the conclusion: if you got some bucks to spare to help my geekness, then [drop me a line](mailto:habi@gna.ch) :-)




**update:** [gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/008886.php#008886) just wrote about the new ultraslim HD-recorders from [sharp](http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/urltrurl?lp=ja_en&url=http://www.sharp.co.jp/corporate/news/030909.html), which includes a firewire-port...
