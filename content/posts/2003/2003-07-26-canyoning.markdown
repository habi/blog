Today i went Canyoning into the Canyon called "chli Schlieren" with Nina, Jacky, Claudsche, Peschi and Sigi!  

It was unbelievable cool. It's so nice to be in the river, slide and jump down the rocks into pools and stuff like that.



[Manu](http://www.outdoor-interlaken.ch/outDoor/index.asp?categoryId=36&activityId=75&activityDetailId=133&openMenu=0&region=) and [Luku](http://www.outdoor-interlaken.ch/outDoor/index.asp?categoryId=36&activityId=75&activityDetailId=135&openMenu=0&region=) were both great guides (i know both of them from school).  


If you're in switzerland, and have nothing else to do, go to Interlaken and do that!

Comment for some other Blog-readers ([B.](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/) and [Miklos](http://www.kozary.com/mt/)): We drove from Interlaken over the Brunig and passed through [Lungern](http://www.panoramawelt.ch/popkamera.htm), how funky is that?
