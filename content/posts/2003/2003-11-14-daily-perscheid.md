since quite a long time i get some daily comics via mail: [calvin and hobbes ](http://www.ucomics.com/calvinandhobbes/)and [the daily perscheid](http://www.raffiniert.ch/stuff.html).
i always think that nearly all [perscheids](http://www.martin-perscheid.de/) are hilariously funny, but this one today just blew the top off everything. not actually the joke itself but the tiny little twist (pun intended) in the preserving jar in the bottom left of the rack. 
(it says "hitlers pen..." which undoubtedly stands for the little mans [dong](http://dict.leo.org/?search=penis&searchLoc=0&relink=on&spellToler=standard&sectHdr=on&tableBorder=1&cmpType=relaxed&lang=en)....)
this made my day!

i have no idea if this is a copyright-issue if i post that picture here on my blog, but i think this goes under "fair use", just to say that [perscheid](http://www.martin-perscheid.de/) is really great!
