do you remember [the movies i made last friday](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000104.html)? i've been fooling around with 'em in [imovie](https://apple.com/imovie/) and must say that this app is quite straight-forward (as soon as you figure out how to import the sound from non-standard-mpegs which my camera produces).
i know there are [much fancier products which are also free](http://www.avid.com/freedv/), but with imovie i was able to make a nice little movie with soundtrack, a little transition and stuff like that in a matter of some dozen minutes without even thinking about reading the manual.
 
but now it's really late, i got a terrible cold and just want to go to bed, i'll upload the movie tomorrow or thursday. i think it's quite funny for a first try in video-editing :-)

good night.
