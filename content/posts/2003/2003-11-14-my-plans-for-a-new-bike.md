yesterday evening i was surfing around some messenger-sites and found that site here: [ostro](http://www.ostro.com.pl/en/main.htm), some shop in poland which sells nice [steel track frames](http://www.ostro.com.pl/en/shop/frames.htm) for an unbelievably low price. 
i mailed those guys and they said that it costs only 20â‚¬ to send [those frames](http://www.ostro.com.pl/en/shop/romet_zoom.html) via ground mail.
how cool is that?

they even send you the color you want. decisions, decisions :-)

ps: even if bikes are not your thing, go check out the [other parts they have on sale](http://www.ostro.com.pl/en/shop/start.html), there are some [really beautiful pieces of craftmanship](http://www.ostro.com.pl/en/shop/camphub_zoom.html)...
