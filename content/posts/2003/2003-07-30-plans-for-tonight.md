I'm gonna go and see [Akua](http://www.akua.ch/) from "Karls Kuhne Gassenschau" with [Nina](https://habi.gna.ch/pics/Aare/Pages/22.html).

PS: hopefully she will not read my blog until we meet (in 40 minutes or so), because it's a surprise for her (for our third anniversary - which was some days ago, but couldn't be celebrated properly, 'cause she had a lot of exams)

**Update:** The show was really [cool](https://habi.bild.li/878/view.html)! The Stunts the Girls and Guys of [Karls Kuhne Gassenschau](http://www.karlskuehnegassenschau.ch) pull off are amazing.
If you've got the chance to go and see them, do it! They just prolonged until the end of september and there are still some tickets available on [their website](http://www.akua.ch/).
