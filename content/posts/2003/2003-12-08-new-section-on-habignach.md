as i'm still looking for a phd in the near future i keep looking for stuff that interests me, medical laser physics-stuff. (i really really reallylove being a messenger, but like kevin bacon says in [quicksilver](https://imdb.com/title/tt0091814/):  "you can't get old on a bike")
[this offer](http://www.telejob.ch/telejob/offer.xml?offer=2661) on [telejob.ch](http://www.telejob.ch/telejob/index.en.html) looks quite promising. 
i sent the contact person an email, asking for some more information on the offer, and thought maybe he also wants some more information on me, so i decided to start with an new category on [habi.gna.ch](https://habi.gna.ch/) - my [cv](https://habi.gna.ch/cv/).
[![](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/cv-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/cv.jpg)
needs to be filled with information (which will hopefully happen soon...), for the moment you can only download my [diploma thesis](https://habi.gna.ch/cv/tissue_soldering_and_precise_cutting.pdf) (a 2.5 mb pdf-file), if you're interested...

btw: [quicksilver](https://imdb.com/title/tt0091814/) is a really great movie if you dig messenger-style stuff, want to have an eighties flashback and just watch an old movie. i nearly couldn't believe that [kevin bacon](https://imdb.com/name/nm0000102/) (yes, mr. [hollow man](https://imdb.com/title/tt0164052/)!) is riding a [fixie](http://www.oldskooltrack.com/files/home.frame.html) throughout the movie, and [riding](http://www.63xc.com/gregg/101_1.htm) it really good, it's something really hard to do [with style](https://habi.gna.ch/pics/SUICMC03_Renzo/index_4.html)...
