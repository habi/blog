**becoming famous:**  

some days ago, inari posted a comment to [one of my posts](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000140.html). i asked her who she was, because i neither recognized the name nor the email-address. then i got back quite a nice reply, saying that she goes to a school of visual communication and is working on a project on web-logs.  

for that work she now analyzes my blog; i already feel weird posting stuff here knowing it will be analyzed :-).  

but nonetheless, it's really nice if someone you do not know tells you that your blog is nice, and that you can be part of a project on web-logs.  
  


one of the questions she had, was where i learned to blog. i never visited a course on blogging or something like this, but i'm used to blog [trifles](http://dict.leo.org/?search=trifles) of my daily business since quite a long time:  

my experience in blogging started more than three years ago with this first post on [IAM](http://iam.bmezine.com/?habi):

just too late again. wanted to go to bed early, but then booted the pc  

and there iam. doddled around in photoshop and then logged into the  

net, and where did i land, shure on bme. then saw shannons new feature  

and just had to test it. but now i'll go to bed!

some thing to note:   




	
  * already three years ago i went to bed much too late (the timezone of [bme](http://www.bmezine.com/) is canada) :-)

	
  * [iam.bmezine.com](http://iam.bmezine.com/) (aka IAM) is a close-gated community created and maintained by [glider](http://iam.bmezine.com/?glider), the creator of quite a [massive online-resource on bodymodification](http://www.bmezine.com/).

	
  * my iam-page also has quite some really personal stuff, which i posted there because i knew (and with the command **IAMONLY** still know) that the entries can be read only by "complete strangers", which makes it really easy to post everything.

	
  * blogging is fun, is kinda like writing a diary, gets you back some old memories and can be done really easy, you just need some web-space where you can run cgi and [movable type](http://www.movabletype.org/) (or only some web-space and [blogger](http://new.blogger.com/)).



**(or not):**   

last week [rolf siegenthaler](http://www.ansicht.net/) called me, he was looking for some models for an ad-campaign for [swisscom fixnet](http://swisscom-fixnet.ch/fx/content/index_EN.html), then i sent him some pictures from me, but the advertizing agency (probably [contexta](http://www.contexta.ch/), as they do most of the stuff for the swisscom...) did not choose me. well, there will be no more [pics of me on the streets](https://habi.gna.ch/pics/CH-Fleisch/) :-)
