i just ripped an old cd i had lying around here: [Overproof](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=MISS70309100629&sql=A2fdsa9qgi23h) from [Rockers Hi-Fi](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=MISS70309100629&sql=Bhy63mpnd9f8o). 
And after i synced it to my ipod, i found out, that i need a bigger one, it's nearly full!!!

btw: the vast majority of all the songs on my ipod (i guess more than 95%) are legally owned/bougth by either me, my flat-mates or another friend i borrowed the CD. i admit that i have some songs that i got through [poisoned](http://www.gottsilla.net/software.php?site=poisoned) or [aquisition](http://www.acquisitionx.com/) (three songs from [Seeed](http://www.seeed.de/), which i saw on the Gurtenfestival last year and Tour de France (the 1983 version, not the new one from 2003) from [Kraftwerk](http://217.69.65.130/de/), are some i remember out of my head...).

i believe in music artists, and i am quite happy to buy cd's, so it's simple: don't steal music...

i have one little story about filesharing: do you remember that old [commercial](https://apple.com/hardware/ads/ipod_beat.html) from apple when they [introduced](http://www.macobserver.com/article/2001/10/26.7.shtml) the [ipod](http://www.apple.com/hardware/video/ipod_intro_480.html)? (click on "commercial" to watch it. it's hilarious!!!)
i've seen it in the openair cinema a year ago and had ages to find the song (take california" -  propellerheads). i was searching hours on kazaa (i had a windows-machine at the university, and wasn't aware of a good file-sharing application on my mac.) to get it and was really happy when i finally could listen to the song. 
then, some weeks later i found out that i actually got the song on a CD i own, on the OST of [The Dancer](https://imdb.com/title/tt0190346/), a movie which i never heard of, but the songs are very good!!!
