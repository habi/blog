you might or might not know that i also work as a bar-tender at the [theater an der effingerstrasse](http://theatereffinger.ch/).
last friday we had the traditional x-mas diner with all the people involved there ([these here](http://theatereffinger.ch/) plus some from the bar).
this year we were at a really excellent restaurant, the [bachmuhle](http://www.bachmuehle.ch/d/Portrait/Index.htm) (the mill at the brook) in [niedermuhlern](http://www.mapquest.com/directions/europe.adp?zoom=5&mapdata=MN1o%2b7MjhN1m470mQpqAUrjkKfYXOx65a5lqED4laxpFR%2fZUpwyiBxn9hv%2bk%2f2p8aQX%2br4yOOpVnz%2fIW%2fWGU1uWW3Lm%2fdq2eR77eq0Lv3mQL%2f741pjMbpWxgZHtCwBbpH0LTS1wV6r9lx5mmQopgqrrwnPZOD5GdHjcsTuvsgPk%2bdWVsW9TBeXrY%2f03U2VxJ7%2bmSIPX3bp8yxY0kJ8mcW8Xvv7%2f5zMNNjOVHO25KGds%3d&2n=SEFTIGEN&1g=eRx6g0FJg5M%253d&1y=CH&1z=3007&2s=Bern&2c=Niedermuhlern&1l=OqoXvOgoUHg%253d&1ex=1&2g=QKJwW%252f%252far%252bc%253d&did=1071444497&1a=Effingerstrasse&un=k&2y=CH&1s=Bern&1c=Bern&2l=mw3JvKyMS%252fo%253d&go=1&ct=EU) (which got 16 points from gault millau, which is quite remarkable).

this story starts really boring, but wait for the funny part: the [chef de service](http://www.bachmuehle.ch/Medien/Bilder/Portraet.jpg) (on the left) at the mill told us that - after finishing his apprenticeship to become a hairdresser - he used to be the butler of [anni-frid lyngstad](http://www.abbasite.com/people/bio.php?id=398).
**you:** who the f... is that? that's not funny at all! this story is boring! 
**me:** she's one of the [abba](http://www.abbafiles.com/)-women! yes, ms. [dancing queen](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=2616957&selectedItemId=2616811)1).

when he told that story, we first could not believe it all, but markus (one of the bosses of the theater) confirmed that story.
and believe me, we nearly couldn't stop shouting [money, money, money](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=373015&selectedItemId=372991)1) or [take a chance on me](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=373015&selectedItemId=372979)1) or [mamma mia](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=402574&selectedItemId=402556)1) each time kjell entered the room.
that was an entertaining evening!

oh, and by the way, [ueli and kjell](http://www.bachmuehle.ch/Medien/Bilder/Portraet.jpg) are a couple, both together have an "i look gay-factor" of 216, ueli himself has a ilg-factor of 1, while kjell gets the remaining 215 points :-)
(from my heterosexual point of view, the only thing ueli could be called is [metrosexual](http://www.wordspy.com/words/metrosexual.asp)...)

1) [ITMS](http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/) links, they only work, if you got [itunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) on your machine (be it either a may or a pc)
