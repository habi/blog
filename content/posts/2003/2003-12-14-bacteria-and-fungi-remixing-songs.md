want to listen to remixes of well known songs by bacteria and [fungi](http://dict.leo.org/?search=fungi)?

have no idea what i'm talking about?
then give the [molecular media project](http://www.swin.edu.au/maths/molecularmediaproject/molecularmedia.htm) or [nanosounds](http://www.nanosounds.com/) a visit and listen to samples of songs which were distorted by a layer of fungi, bacteria and other stuff on the surface of the cd's.

the [remix of pink floyds comfortably numb](http://www.swin.edu.au/maths/molecularmediaproject/audio/pinkfloyd-comfortablynumb-molecularcomputing.mp3) (750kb mp3) is especially mindbending! and also quite funny to watch are the psychedelic screenshots of a [james brown DVD](http://www.swin.edu.au/maths/molecularmediaproject/t02carbonb/titaniumdioxide-carbonblack.html) remixed by titanium dioxide.
