take a look at [this website](http://www.irobotnow.com/index.php) for a too-good-to-be-true robot, the NS-5.
those of you that read or used to read [Isaac Asimov](http://www.asimovonline.com/) novels will get it at the first look that this page must be in some kind related to him, because of that little saying in the bottom left corner: "3 laws safe": ![](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/3lawssafe.jpg)
and when you perform a [WHOIS-check](http://www.register.com/whois-results.cgi?be5dfbe7d0268a14b7519d86cab1c8d185b19eb43af1a3791cd32882dd7a6f9a1f76ed8c3c055feea42e5da4a5c8bac4) on who registered the domain [irobotnow.com](http://www.irobotnow.com/index.php) then you see that the whole thing is probably a marketing campaign to make you want to see the upcoming film by [20th century fox](http://www.fox.com/home.htm), [i robot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/).

i want to see it! 

i'm a really big fan of asimovs stories, if you've never read one, then go and grab [i, robot](http://www.buchkatalog.de/kod-bin/isuche.cgi?dbname=Buchkatalog&lang=deutsch&uid=butotest-18122003-22251000&caller=butotest&usecookie=ja&AU=asimov&aktion=next&bereich3=8-8) or [the foundation trilogy](http://www.buchkatalog.de/kod-bin/isuche.cgi?dbname=Buchkatalog&lang=deutsch&uid=butotest-18122003-22251000&caller=butotest&usecookie=ja&AU=asimov&aktion=next&bereich3=6-6) or any other book of him. they're quite good on the science-fiction part, but even better on the philosophical part. 
he wrote a lot of stories turning around [the three laws of robotics ](http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series13), which imply really interesting situations on how robots could interact with humans, hence the "3 laws safe" is quite a giveaway :-)

**update**: [macslash](http://macslash.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/19/0939217&mode=thread) is covering another aspect of the NS-5 campaign.
