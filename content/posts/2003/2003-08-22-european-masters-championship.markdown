Next week i will probably not update my blog at all, because i'll be at the [European Masters Championship](http://www.ffnatation.org/events/mtr_millau_2003/index.html) in [Millau](http://www.wunderground.com/global/stations/07558.html), [France](http://www.ffnatation.org/events/mtr_millau_2003/millau.php?idlng=gbr&idrub=mil).
I'm quite a keen [swimmer](http://www.skbe.ch/) and am going to swim [some disciplines](http://www.ffnatation.org/events/mtr_millau_2003/millau.php?idlng=gbr&idrub=prg&idact=nat) there (200m Crawl, 100m Crawl, 50m Butterfly and a 5km open water swimming in the Lake Pareloup)
So don't be mad at me if i do not update at all next week, i have no idea if i'll have internet access at [the place we're staying](http://www.planete-capvert.com/english/planete/index.htm) (maybe this is also a good thing for me so i'll be able to read and sleep a lot :-)

cheerio!
