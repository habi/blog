today i thought i needed to go for a little walk. 
as i live really near the [allmend](http://www.stadion-wankdorf.ch/) here in bern i thought, thats a good idea to go there. but then i discovered that it's not your typical sunday walk today, instead there was  [some motorbike exhibition](http://www.swissperformance.ch/home/swiss.html).
although i am no fan of motorized stuff, i couldn't help watching those guys doing some truly impressing [FMX](http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&Acronym=FMX&Find=Find) stunts.
