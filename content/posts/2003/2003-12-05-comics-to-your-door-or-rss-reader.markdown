[b.](http://bernhardseefeld.ch/) pointed out a nice service to me (i wonder where he gets all that stuff he forwards to me :-).
[tapestry](http://dwlt.net/tapestry/), a service by some guy that converts (some) online comics into rss-feed so you can [suck them down with whatever you like](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/).
i've still not jet decided if it's a good thing if i add comics to my daily "keep up with all your rss-subscriptions"-task.
at least i have to spend less time watching ads and other stuff to load :-)

(tapestry should add [nichtlustig](http://www.nichtlustig.de/main.html), the [daily perscheid](http://www.raffiniert.ch/stuff.html) and [other comics](http://portale.web.de/Boulevard/Comics/), too, then i could stop getting comics by mail...)
