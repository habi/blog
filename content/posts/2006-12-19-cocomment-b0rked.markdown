[![Cocomment](https://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/cocomment-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/cocomment.jpg)hm, i just wanted to comment on [the sweet deal on b.'s blog](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/archives/000117.html) and found out that i haven't yet installed the cocomment plugin for firefox on my new mac. so i wanted to do that, but then i couldn't log into cocomment. no big deal, i'll just let me send a new password. but then cocomment complains that my username and my email don't exist in their database anymore. hmm, weird.
and the really weird thing is, that there seems to be absolutely nothing in their database anymore... see for yourself [here](http://www.cocomment.com/explore):
what is happening? or is it only because i'm at a free hotspot?

[update]: whatever it was, it's fixed now:
