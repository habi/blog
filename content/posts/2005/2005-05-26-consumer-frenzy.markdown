[![Threadlesss](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/threadlesss-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/threadlesss.jpg)omg! 
  
i just couldn't resist. after stumbling over a link to the [threadless t-shirts](http://www.threadless.com/) on [waxy.org](http://www.waxy.org/links/) i ordered ten t-shirts from them, because i could not decide which ones to get, they're all almost too cool not to buy. i got into a complete shopping frenzy, because all the t-shirts are only 10$ until june 6th. and because i really really love printed t-shirts i ended up maniacally clicking on the "add to cart" button.
  
could you have resisted, when you see a t-shirt with an ice bear on it? i guess you could have resisted, but not me...



ps: [splint](http://splint.ch/indexf.htm), one of the t-shirts is a gift for you, guess which one.
