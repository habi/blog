i just can't stop skiing....
  
my parents spend a week on the [bettmeralp](http://www.bettmeralp.ch/e/) and i've been visiting them for three days. the weather was quite bad, but the snow was perfect, and i really start to like [my new skis](http://www.freeskishop.net/images/ski/p3.jpg).
  
the pic below shows me having some fun in a locker at the cable car station (yes i'd have fit in, but then the picture would be only half as funny...)
