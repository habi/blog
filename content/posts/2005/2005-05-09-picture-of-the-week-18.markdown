i've been diving this weekend, and christened my [underwater-case](http://images.google.com/images?q=mpk-thb&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&sa=N&tab=wi) for my digital camera. turns out that it's quite hard to take good pictures in the Mediterranean in may. i'm sorting through all the pictures, but at a first glance i liked the one below quite good.
  
it's sigi at about 16m below surface exiting the cave at the dive-site tres covas. looks like a thing from outer space.
