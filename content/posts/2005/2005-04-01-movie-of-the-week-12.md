i spent the weekend in london with nina (just like [other people did](http://www.kozary.com/blog/miklos/index.php?p=45)...) and didn't have time to sort through all the pictures i took. can you remember the times when you took something like ten pictures on a whole weekend? ah, the good old analog times. but nonetheless i got a kick out of that little movie i quickly hacked together in imovie. it's the tower bridge (not the london bridge!) opening for a ship to go through, with a little squeaky door effect i added. and if you recognize the song from which i took the opening riff, i'll pay you a beer, the next time we meet! (tip: the song title contains london...)

ps: i'll surely share some pictures with you, but now i gotta run, nina has something to celebrate - she passed her exams!
