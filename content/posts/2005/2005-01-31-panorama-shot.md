[![Gensingen](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/gensingen-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/gensingen.mov)finally i've been able to hack together a panorama of the pool we've been swimming in in [gensingen](https://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/sets/88024/). if you click on the image on the left you should be able to open the 432kb-file and see how the pool looked from left to right. mind the bad quality of the panorama, but it was shot without tripod and a whimsy camera.
