i'm in the process of moving all my data from my ibook to my new g4 (it's not new, i bought it used, but it's new for me...). does anyone of you kind readers out there have an idea on how to do that smooth and seamless? i tried ccc, but that didn't work really good, cause some os-extensions behave different on g3s and g4s... what files and directories do i need to transfer (with the excellent [dropcopy](http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20050211.html) for example...)?
