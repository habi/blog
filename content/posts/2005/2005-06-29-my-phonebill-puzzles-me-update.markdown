today i just got my sunrise mobile phone-bill, and i was quite puzzled by one item on it. i've used gprs three times this month (not a hardcore user, am i...).
  
twice [[1](http://moblog.co.uk/view.php?id=68770), [2](https://flickr.com/photos/habi/19741352/)] to send a moblog-post from switzerland resulting in a total data rate of 248 kB, and once [[3](http://moblog.co.uk/view.php?id=63506)] to send a moblog-post from spain which was 113 kB heavy.
  
the thing that now puzzles me, is that i actually paid less for my data in spain, although i was roaming with [Telefonica](http://telefonica.es/) there. 
  
in switzerland i paid [0.02 CHF per kB](http://www.sunrise.ch/privatkunden/mobiltelefonieren/mobilesinternet/live/live_preise.htm), which results in a price of 20.50 CHF per MB (!!!).
  
in spain, i paid 0.0116 CHF per kB, resulting in a price of 11.90 per MB, which is nearly half the price i pay in switzerland. and remember, i was [roaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming) with my swiss phone on a spanish network, so i surely didn't pay the least expensive price there.



ain't that unbelievable? guess it's time to look into other options for sending that occasional moblog from my phone. [sunrise](http://www.sunrise.ch/index.htm) do you hear me? data is much too expensive with you!!!
  
do you have any tips to lower my phone bill?
