today i got an email from the [flickr-team](https://flickr.com/): in the aftermath of yahoo buying flickr the guys and gals are able to provide [more stuff for all the users](https://blog.flickr.net/en/2005/04/18/new-prices-freebies-and-rock/):

- 20 mb upload limit for all free users 
- for all pro users (like me), e.g. those who paid for an extended account: an extension to two years, so i get double the bang for my bucks and
- 2 invites for a pro account to give away.

this leads me to a little contest: i'm donating those two accounts to you, yes you.
but because i (occasionally) get more than two readers, you have to fight :-)
  
send me a convincing picture or something other that justifies the donation of an account from me to you [1].

[1]: since there's a bit more involved than with a [gmail invite](https://habi.gna.ch/?s=gmail), the hurdles are also a bit higher.
i think, for instance, i must know you (least a bit) personally and must think that i could like your pictures...
