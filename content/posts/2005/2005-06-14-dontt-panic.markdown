monday night i went to see [the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy](https://imdb.com/title/tt0371724/) (with a towel). i finished the book on the sunday before, so i had all fresh in my mind. i thought i will be disappointed with the movie, 'cause let's face it, there's just not enough time to fit all the gags from the book into one movie (sequel anyone?).
  
nonetheless i enjoyed the movie a great bit (my flatmates rita and dan also did), it's very fast paced and chockfull of references to the book, but also chockfull of new ideas, some of them really brilliant. if you go and see the movie, wait through the credits, in the end, there's another [entry of the guide](https://imdb.com/title/tt0371724/crazycredits) for you to see (warning: spoiler behind the link).
  
if you've seen the film, then those extremely fast [42 games](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exhibitions/hitchhikers/swfs/42gamepopup.asp) will be even funnier than they are already!
