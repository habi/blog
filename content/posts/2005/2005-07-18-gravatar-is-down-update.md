you might have noticed that my [gravatars](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000576.html) are not displayed anymore. this is because gravatar.com is down at the moment[1].
  
there is a [workaround](http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php?title=gravatar_com_is_down_what_could_we_do_if&more=1&amp;c=1&tb=1&pb=1), but i'll just wait for some days and see if the issue resolves itself, before i start to mess with some code.



[1] not really down, but their [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS) is [b0rked](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=b0rked) somehow. see [technorati](http://technorati.com/search/gravatar) for more info...



**update:** they're back on track.
