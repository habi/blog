i've been experimenting with panoramas quite a bit lately [1]. and with huginosx it's really easy to align ramarkably good panoramas even with handheld pictures, like i've done it in the one below.

[![Velodemo High](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/velodemo_high-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/velodemo_high.jpg)

this wednesday the [ja!](http://jungealternative.ch/2005_aktionen/2005_06_29_velodemo.html) [2] made a bike demonstration in bern. they wanted to protest against the newest plans to slash the free bike-parking around the main station here in [bern](https://flickr.com/photos/tags/bern). because of the thunderstorm that just started minutes after the demonstration was about to begin there were not too many people. i tried to document that with that panorama, which makes the waisenhausplatz look quite empty with that little bunch of protesters on it...

[1] maybe you've watched my [panorama](https://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/panorama) tag over at flickr.

oh, and [raph](http://velocite.ch/weblogtoo/), i'm still waiting for the [CMWC-tag](https://flickr.com/photos/tags/cmwc) (or maybe [cmwc2005](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/cmwc2005)) to get filled!

[2] we never were 70 people. i counted when we were on the [bundesplatz](https://flickr.com/photos/tags/bundesplatz), and we were exactly 34... oh, and can you spot me on [that picture](http://jungealternative.ch/images/2005/2005_06_29_veloDEMO/2005_06_29_veloDEMO-018.jpg)?

[3] i really love tagging :-)
