[![Dsc00734](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC00734-tm.jpg)](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC00734.jpg)yesterday evening i went to see the [luftstation](http://oeffoeff.ch/projects/luftstation.php), the newest production from the [offoff-team](http://oeffoeff.ch/).
  
from a competition in the [kulturagenda](http://www.kulturagenda.be/)/[bund](http://www.espace.ch/page_162.html) i won a VIP-package: i was able to [mount the luftstation](https://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/19942736/in/set-467068/) with the artists, which was really a great experience, although it only lasted for two minutes or so. then all the winner had some time to talk with the artists and learn some more on how the amazing steel-sculpture was built. all in all, it was a great evening on the gurten



because you were allowed to take pictures i managed to take some shots during the performance, some of them turned out quite nice (although wiggly through the long exposure). you can take a look at them over at the [luftstation-set](https://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/sets/467068/) on flickr.



if you got the time, go and see it, it's absolutely worth it (and on the [gurten](http://www.gurtenpark.ch/gurten) you might even manage to see it for free from the backside...). offoff are [touring through switzerland](http://oeffoeff.ch/dates/termine.php) until the end of the year, so there's really no excuse for missing it.
