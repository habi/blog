just in case you haven't [seen it](http://moblog.co.uk/view.php?id=41304) over at my moblog.



i was having quite a boring afternoon, i never got out of the inner part of the city (happens sometimes...). and normally we don't get that many jobs after 7. and one at 19.26 out to the kasparstrasse is really unusual. and from lausanne even more...



so: thanks for the banana thingies, i ate one when i unloaded the parcel from the train, it made me go really fast...
  
you know who you are.



and all the others: this is an insider-story, just don't bother....
