i've [already mentioned some mash-ups](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&search=mash+up), here comes one more, not exactly a mash-up, but a band that mixes metallica and beatles songs: [beatallica](http://www.beatallica.com/). all 11 songs can be conveniently downloaded as [a torrent-file](http://waxy.org/bt/torrents/Beatallica.torrent) or as single .mp3-downloads. get them while they last.



oh, and just to make this post more complete (or actually post a real mash-up), did i ever mention [the beastles](http://halley.lunarpages.com/~djbc002/beastles/)? an excellent mash-up between the beatles and the beastie boys.
