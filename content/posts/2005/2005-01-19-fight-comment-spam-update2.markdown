google takes a new measure in fighting comment spam. [they implemented](https://google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html) a new attribute for hyperlinks - rel="nofollow" - which prevents links from being spidered. so when google (or any [other](http://blogs.msdn.com/msnsearch/archive/2005/01/18/nofollow_tags.aspx) [search](http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000069.html) engines that support the attribute) parses a link with that attribute the links don't get credits in the rankings of the catalog. this is one of the first measure to make blog-spamming really uninteresting.
  
many (blog)systems are already able to cope with the new attribute, i installed the [nofollow plugin for MT](http://www.movabletype.org/news/2005/01/movable_type_nofollow_p.shtml), so spammers can sod off!
  
[jayallen](http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/2005/01/massive_weblog_antispam_initiative_relnofollow) (of mtblacklis fame) also has a nice post covering the pro's and con's of that measure.
  
now i have to finish that "internet"-script i have to hand out to [the class](http://schule-kirchberg.ch/) tomorrow.
  
good night.

**update:** hm, maybe i've shot too fast.



like [b.](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/archives/000102.html) and [ben hammersley](http://www.benhammersley.com/weblog/2005/01/20/let_no_fellow_nofollow_lest_we_all_lie_fallow.html) noted, the whole thing might backfire. it's also a sign on how powerful google is. 
  
heck, do i use something else to scour the web for information? no, just sometimes i head over to search.ch...
  
i look forward to having a talk with b. soon. when everything works out, we'll see each other this weekend (for a little [game](http://targot.net/)). 



**update2: **i deleted the nofollow-plugin from my MT-installation after reading [here](http://www.nonofollow.net/).
