no matter how you think about trusted computing, you should take a look at that really nice street-art-styled movie [1] from [lutz vogel](http://pixelamusement.com/) [2] and [benjamin stephan](http://www.lafkon.net/). you can either watch it directly on [the movie-site](http://lafkon.net/tc/) or download it [here](http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~lvogel/tc/) in different formats and sizes or (maybe preferred to all the people involved) leech it with your desired bittorrent-client through [this file](http://www.lafkon.net/tc/trusted-computing.torrent).
  
definitely worth those three and a half minutes!
