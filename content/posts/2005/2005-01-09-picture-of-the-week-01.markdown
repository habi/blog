yesterday i've been diving again. yes, diving in the cold [thuner-see](http://map.search.ch/oberhofen-be?x=254&y=126), the water was around 5Â°C. we've [again](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000386.html) been at the schönörtli (german for nice place).
  
because i wore [a dry suit](http://www.whitescoldwater.com/) [1] i was only nearly freezing my ass off (more the hands than the ass, 'cause i was wearing wet gloves). the dive was really spectacular, the sight underwater was amazing, much better than in the summer. and it's really fun to dive with a dry suit, you feel like stuck in a balloon and can shift the air in thta balloon depending on the position you have. the picture below shows raymond and beat during their dive, having a break at the surface. can you see how clear the water is, you're able to see the stones at the bottom...
  
my lesson learned: winter bike leggings are not suited as undergarment in a dry suit. a thick woolen jumper is suited.
