since [nina](https://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/nina/) also started to use skype i thought i'd might give it another go.
  
so if you feel the desperate urge to call me, you can do it and call me via this button [1]: [![](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/buttons/skype.png)](//david.haberthuer) 
  
(but be aware: since i bought a powerpc i don't have a built in microphone, i need to go and buy one, so you might want to wait a day or two...)



[1]: button via the excellent [button maker](http://kalsey.com/tools/buttonmaker/).



**update:** something with my soundcard is [b0rked](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=b0rked). the mic works really well (tested with flatmates peecee). but i just cannot get any sound out of it. the microphone gain is on maximum.
  
can anyone suggest some help?



**update2:** after buying [a bluetooth headset](http://www.globetechnology.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050303.gtscalamar3/BNStory/TechReviews/) and [a new bluetooth dongle](http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=34) (both used and from ricardo.ch), i switched to bluetooth-skype, so everything should work, give it a go...
