since i borrowed star wars VI to VI and the godfather I to III from andi and karin they asked me what movies they can borrow from me. because my dvd-collection is rather big [1] it was easier for me to just upload an export from my library in dvdpedia [2] to the web.
  
if you want to see what movies i got, then you can step over to /movies.
  
if you'd like to borrow one, just drop me a line.
  

  
[1] 117 pieces at the moment, two of them are missing...
  
[2] another one of the rare pieces of software i bought.
  

  
it's gone, since i upgraded to tiger
