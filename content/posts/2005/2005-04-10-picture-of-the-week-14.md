finally i got some time to sort through the pile of pictures i took on vacation in london. it' amazing how many pictures you take, when you don't have to care about any restrictions. the one below was taken in the [tate modern](http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/), a very impressive old power-station converted by [Herzog & de Meuron](http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/building/architect.htm), two swiss architects. the main hall (see a panorama [here](http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/building/panorama/pano.htm)) serves as the "main floor" for exhibitions and was only filled with some loudspeakers (by[ bruce naumann](http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/nauman/)) (that exhibition was about as good as the link is...). nonetheless i was able to get quite a good shot of the eerie afternoon glow outside.
