[matthias](http://blog.ch/) posted "[I'll Ask You Something I've Always Wondered About You?](http://www.gutfeldt.ch/matthias/blog/singleblog.php?entry=1129859418)" quite some time ago on his personal [blog](http://www.gutfeldt.ch/matthias/blog/index.php).
  
i just loved the thought of him saying things about me and now he finally did, read the - funny - "answers" in this [post](http://gutfeldt.ch/matthias/blog/singleblog.php?entry=1132714202).



rule #8 of the little game says, that i must post it here, which is what i do here.
  
the rules are as follows: leave your name (and web-address) in [a comment](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000697.html#comments) below and...




  * I'll respond with something random about you.


  * I'll tell you what song/movie reminds me of you.


  * I'll pick a flavor of jello to wrestle with you in.


  * I'll try to say something that only makes sense to you and me.


  * I'll tell you my first/clearest memory of you.


  * I'll tell you what animal you remind me of.


  * I'll ask you something that I've always wondered about you.


  * If I do this for you, you must post this on your journal. You MUST.
