[michael](http://www.gps-technologies.com/Kontakt/kontakt.html) sent me his pictures from the philippines. i really like the one he took of nina and me while at the [tamarraw falls](https://flickr.com/photos/habi/48388342/) on our daytrip over the island. looks a bit like photoshopped, but i guarantee it's real :-)
