like you've seen below, i've been skiing with tom yesterday.
  
in adelboden i took the 4000th picture with my digital cam(s)[1], [2]. i would have loved it to be the one with the wires, but it was a self-portrait of me on the chair lift. so i'll just post both.

[1]: i know, i took much more, since i also delete a lot, but the picture of me is number 4000 in my iphoto library
  
[2]: the first picture is from end of may 2001, so i took around 2.5 pictures each and every day. wicked!
