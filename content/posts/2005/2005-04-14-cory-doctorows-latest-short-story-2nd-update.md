cory doctorow (of [boingboing-fame](https://boingboing.net/)) released a short story called [i, robot](https://boingboing.net/2005/02/16/corys_latest_short_s.html). since i like reading stuff on my clie while on the train or so i made a palm-doc file of the story.
  
if you'd like to read the story on your palm, then you can get it here: [cory doctorow - i, robot.pdb](https://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/cory%20doctorow%20-%20i,%20robot.pdb) (49 kb)
  
for converting the file i used [PorDiBle](http://pordible.victoly.com/), a nifty palm-doc conversion tool, which is absolutely fabulous to convert any text or rtf-file to a compressed .pdb file. this (and the [adobe reader for palm os](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html)) helps me to read any file i want on my clie.
  
have fun with it.



after talking to cory i found out that his publisher holds the exclusive rights on the stories for two months. so i couldn't release the file until today, but anyway, here it is for all of you to abuse.



**update: **[eileen](http://www.infinitematrix.net/faq/personnel.html#Gunn) released the file. you can also grab it on [the infinite matrix-site](http://www.infinitematrix.net/stories/shorts/i-robot.html#pdb).



**2nd update:** i've been [boingboinged](https://boingboing.net/2005/04/16/corys_i_robot_for_th.html)...
