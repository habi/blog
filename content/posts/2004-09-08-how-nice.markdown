look what mail i just got:



<blockquote>Would you like to donate your picture of the dugong 
http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/Image009_8.jpg to a good cause?

Dugong photos are very hard to find, and yours is truly wonderful.

We all love to make it available to people for a desktop. Here are some desktops donated by other photographers.

This would help support our work to prevent the US govt from building an airbase on top of a dugong feeding ground in Japan.

Here is more about that lawsuit against the US Department of Defense.

Look forward to hearing from you. If you are willing, we would need the largest pixel version you have. Send to me. 

Tell us how to credit the photo.

Thanks,

that's quite nice. i think i'll hand them over the three pics i took of the dugong.
if brian is a really nice guy he can send me something from [my amazon wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/18WMBOFMWI1DN/104-2368767-7758322) or just say thank you, and credit my work correctly. everything here is released under a [creative commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) anyway ([creative commons](http://creativecommons.org/) is by the way one of the winners of a [golden nica](http://www.aec.at/en/prix/winners2004.asp) at the [ars eletronica](http://www.aec.at/en/index.asp) in linz which just finished yesterday or so...).
if you want to read some more about the AEC and get a good insight of the things that happened there, then [piece](https://pieceoplastic.com/) has [some good coverage](http://pieceoplastic.com/index.php?cat=23) on on what he did there.
