i just returned from seeing [bauchklang](http://www.bauchklang.at/) live at the [bierhubeli](http://www.bierhuebeli.ch/).
if you've never heard of them, then you should go and check out their website.
bauchklang is the so called vocal groove project. they make [dubby drum n bass](http://www.ishkur.com/features/music/) [acapella](http://www.cobwebaudio.co.uk/sound_samples/acapella.html). it is really amazing, what those five guys achieve with only their voice and microphones.
go hear some samples (in the goodies section), it's really not [that kind](http://www.pickets.co.uk/) [of acapella-music](http://www.five4one.de/) you think!
if you got a fast connection, then [click here for a direct link to a 11mb-quicktime-movie](http://www.bureaumd.de/DATA/bauchklang/visitor.Copy.01_broadband.mov) from their site to see how they perform on stage.
