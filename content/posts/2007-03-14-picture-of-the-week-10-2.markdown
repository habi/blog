quite some time ago (for my birthday actually) i got a voucher for a weekend in the snow with a big surprise from my love. this weekend we finally managed to find a weekend with snow and free time. in the end it turned out that she planned a weekend on the [bettmeralp](http://www.bettmeralp.ch/) for skiing and some wellness in the [hotel bettmerhof](http://www.bettmeralp.ch/). the weather was absolutely gorgeous and also the slopes were really good.
the whole weekend was already a surprise for me, so i was not expecting something special when we went for a drink after hitting the slopes. only after the [prinoth everest power](http://tinyurl.com/23qano) [1] parked for quite a long time besides us i got a bit suspicious on what nina planned for the big surprise. you might not know that i've always said that it's a little dream of me to ride with one of those machines - throttle fully open - on a skiing slope...

nina actually managed to get us a ride in a snow cat. in the end we rode a bit more than an hour with the guy who answered all my questions. it was very cool, those machines have a rather impressive power when going uphill. if you want to see what it looks like in a snowcat, you can see the images i took on [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/prinoth), or even watch a [little movie on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ2121-D64I)...

on sunday the weather was again marvelous (as you can see from the images in the [full set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/sets/72157594582740761/)). when standing on the bettmerhorn the view on the [aletschgletscher](http://www.aletschgletscher.ch) is absolutely breath-taking. the image below is a panorama stitched from 9 images showing the glacier from its beginning on the left to the ever shortening end (and a nearly blinded nina on the right).
