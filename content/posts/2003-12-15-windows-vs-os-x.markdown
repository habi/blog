why the hell did [no](http://www.kozary.com/mt/)-[one](http://www.slf.ch/staff/pers-home/sigrist/sigrist-en.html) [tell](http://armand.bild.li/) me that my page looks shite with a windows-browser?
today i was at school and wanted to show someone a link i had posted somewhere here and then to my amazement [habi.gna.ch](http://habi.gna.ch/) lookes a bit like the "[eyesore of the month](http://www.kunstler.com/eyesore_200311.html)" on a windows-machine.  

well, it think there need to be tweaked quite a few bits and pieces in the css :-). and the sidebar (first set) looks quite ugly with these blue lines around the buttons, i think i should also change that, to prevent burnt retinas...  

the funny thing is that the page looks nearly the same with [safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/), [opera](http://www.opera.com/), [camino](http://www.mozilla.org/products/camino/) and [internet explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/internetexplorer/internetexplorer.aspx?pid=internetexplorer) on my machine, so who would have thought that it looks that different on windows.
