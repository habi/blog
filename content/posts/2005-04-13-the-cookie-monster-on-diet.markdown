the [swiss late news](http://www.sfdrs.ch/system/frames/news/10vor10/index.php) aired a newscast that the cookie monsters eating habits are getting a makeover, so he is not allowed to eat more unhealthy cookies. the americans thought it's bad, when they see a monster on telly which eats cookies (and letters :-) all the time, so they changed his diet to more healthy stuff. this gets scary i think. when will they change other tv-series? how long will it take before [dexter](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/dexter/) is not allowed to work in his lab anymore, because working with big tools and electricity is dangerous for kids. how long will it take before [pippi langstrumpf](http://images.google.com/images?q=pippi%20langstrumpf&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&sa=N&tab=wi) has to stop running around and lifting horses, because that's dangerous for kids? oh man, this just gets me the creeps. it's a friggin' monster, so he can eat what he wants, and doesn't need to eat healthy!



if you like, you can watch [the german news-broadcast here](http://real.xobix.ch/ramgen/sfdrs/10vor10/2005/10vor10_13042005-450k.rm?start=0:23:02.622&end=0:24:53.866) (in real-video-format). or if you want to read some more on that, then head over to [news.google](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=cookie+monster&btnG=Search+News). i'm going to bed and will hopefully dream of a big bowl of cookies. good night.
