the first few glimpes i've seen since the download started1 make it look like [THE uber-messenger-movie](http://www.digave.com/videos/red-web.mpg), but i definitely need to go to bed now, i'll download the whole movie tomorrow and let you know.
but be warned, the movie of a rider filming an [alleycat](http://messengers.org/events/) through manhattan with his helmet-camera is a hefty 50 mb big!

**update**: after viewing the whole film today i got to mention that we're all wussies here in bern.
