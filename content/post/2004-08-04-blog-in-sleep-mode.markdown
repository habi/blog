there won't be any updates here for at least the next two weeks, because i'm on holidays.
nina and i will be diving in the red sea and stay at the [flameco beach resort](http://www.flamencohotels.com/quseir/index.html) in el quseir.
have a good time and behave while i'm away.

ps: perhaps there will be one or two tiny updates on my [moblog](http://moblog.co.uk/blogs.php?show=835), but don't count on it, because i'm on holidays!
