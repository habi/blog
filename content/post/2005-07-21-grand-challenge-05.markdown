hopefully this year's [grand challenge](http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/) will be more of a success than [the last one](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&search=grand+challenge).
  
at least there's hope, because a [contestant](http://team.gobanzai.com/home.html) is driven by max os x (albeit there could be a kernel panic on track :-)



if you forgot how the last year's edition ended, then [this boingboing-post](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/30/darpa_grand_challeng.html) links to a [video excerpt](http://stc-www2.tamu.edu/grandchallenge/grandchallenge-high.wmv) (31mb .wmv) of the satellite-feed from the 04-edition, so you can see for yourself how [craptacularly](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=craptacular) bad most of the autonomous vehicles drove.
