[![](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/ch-fleisch-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/ch-fleisch.jpg)
The campaign for [Swiss Meat](http://www.schweizerfleisch.ch/) which i [modeled](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/CH-Fleisch/) started again. 
As [BÃ¤rni pointed out](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/archives/000044.html), i'm a vegetarian (strict since about four years, loose one since longer time), but i look like a happy meat eater on these pictures.
So if you see one of these ads, then you know that it's just an ad and not a true situation :-) 

By the way, check out some other works by [Franziska Frutiger](http://www.foto-ff.com/), the photographer which made these pics, she sports some pretty nice pictures on her website (you might recognize some other shots from ads (swisscom and a campaign for the chemical industry in switzerland).

**PS:** I'm the one in the orange jumper...
