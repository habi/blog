in the [paper](http://www.ebund.ch/) today: [a picture](http://www.derbund.ch/ebund.asp?SOURCE=/Publications/DER_BUND/2003/283/WISSEN/201056.html) of what would happen if you put all the water on the earth and air in the atmosphere in one sphere above the earth ([pdf of the original page](http://www.derbund.ch/pdf.asp?SOURCE=/Publications/PDF/DER_BUND/2003/283/27.PDF)). almost unbelievably small!!

**update:** the pdf is only availiable if you are a subscriber to the archive, which puts you back 60 bucks a year. nonetheless i leave the link, maybe you are a subscriber....

**update 2:** [the linked page](http://www.visions-of-science.co.uk/) has some quite interesting pictures!
