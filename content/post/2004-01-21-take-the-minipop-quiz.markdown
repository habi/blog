how good do you know famous people?
how good do you know them when they're reduced to some pixels? 
download [this excel-file](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/minipopsquiz_clear.xls) (256kb) and see for yourself!
(open the file, then insert the names. watch for the the's, e.g. "a-team" is wrong while "the a-team" is correct.
yes, they're really there)

i managed to recognise 19, but with [sigi](http://www.slf.ch/staff/pers-home/sigrist/sigrist-en.html)'s suggestions we managed to get 27 of 95 right. (i'd never ever recognized the corrs and simon & garfunkel).
how much do you get right? leave a comment!

**btw**: perhaps you wonder how i got that file?
no, not from [flipflopflyin](http://www.flipflopflyin.com/), where [all](http://www.flipflopflying.com/shop/minipopsposter72dpi.html) the [minipops](http://www.flipflopflying.com/minipops/index.html) come from (and [david with one long arm](http://www.flipflopflyin.com/david/), too) but through pure coincidence!
yesterday evening i was trying out some [tiny urls](http://tinyurl.com/):
- [my tiny url](http://tinyurl.com/habi) leads to a 404-page
- [my sisters tiny url](http://tinyurl.com/nina) leads to a .dmg of some program to vectorize images.
- [my girl's tiny url](http://tinyurl.com/nini) leads to the times online.
- and [sigi](http://www.slf.ch/staff/pers-home/sigrist/sigrist-en.html)'s [tiny url](http://tinyurl.com/sigi) leads to the aforementioned file.
see? pure coincidence!
