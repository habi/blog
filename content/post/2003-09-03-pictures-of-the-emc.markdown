the pictures i made in Millau at the [Swimming Championsship](http://www.ffnatation.org/events/mtr_millau_2003/millau.php?idlng=gbr&idrub=acc&idact=hom) are [online here](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/Millau/).

PS1: my results in the pool can be found [here](http://www.ffnatation.org/webffn/mtr/xx_live_nag.php?idcpt=567&idlng=gbr&idclb=SKBE%20BERN) (i'm david haberthuer by the way :-). The open-water results [here](http://www.ffnatation.org/events/mtr_millau_2003/millau.php?idlng=gbr&idrub=res&idact=eau) (i'm not really happy with the time i swam in the lake (5.2 km in 1:43, but i had a major cramp in both legs which made me make a break for about five minutes, so it's not too bad...)
PS2: [this site here](http://www.brueckenweb.de/Datenbank/bruecken/brueckenblatt.php?bas=3800) has a lot of infos on the bridge you can see in my pics..
PS3: because i visited [one of the caves where they produce the roquefort-cheese](http://www.roquefort-societe.com/) i'm gonna cook [that](http://frenchfood.about.com/library/blroqpasta.htm) tomorrow.
