* silvaplana was so great, that bruni bought a kite and a board from a [guy](http://kitesurfshop.ch/) that was up there.


	
  * todays fun link is sponsored by the [friends of folk music](http://volksmusikfreunde.ch/). (i saw a sticker with that link on the back of some guys motorcycle today...)

	
  * [azure](http://web.vee.net/projects/azure/) works only a little bit. i managed to post while on the train, but not while on the camping in silvaplana and on the beach at the lake. so still some work to do to get a 1.0 version...
