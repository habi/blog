when i came home from the [european masters championship](http://www.ffnatation.org/events/mtr_millau_2003/millau.php?idlng=gbr&idrub=new) i started up my trusty ibook to read the mails which came in through the week.
and was quite puzzled :-) 135 mails in one week...
[![](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/sobig-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/sobig.jpg)
after skimming some of them i found out that the vast majority of them were virus-mails (the virus is [sobig-f](http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.sobig.f@mm.html)). 
after follwing [one of the hints](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20030820063155258) on [osxhints.com](http://www.macosxhints.com/) (btw. one of the best sites for hints regarding a [truly beautiful os](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)) i only had something like 25 real emails in my inbox, which was much more what i thought it would be :-)
i didn't use the mail rule proposed in the hint, which seemed a bit harsh, but followed the last comment to that hint)

some pictures and other stuff from the championship are coming soon, now i need to go to bed, because i only slept for four hours the last night and have to teach some kids physics in about eight hours... looking forward to my bed!
