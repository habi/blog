it seems harder and harder each year: whenever holiday season comes nearer, i by choice try to stay completely offline, so i can conquer my [extralineophobia](http://www.google.com/search?q=extralineophobia) [1], read some books, go for walks, go [skiing](http://identi.ca/notice/1540890), cook nice and take some pictures (not that I buy a new camera each year). so, i've shut down my computer and switched off EDGE and WLAN on my phone, so I shouldn't be too tempted to go online for the next few days. i'll be back sometimes in early 2009. cu!
