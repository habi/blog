this friendly door looks like [weebl and bobs](http://www.weebl.jolt.co.uk/) big brother, don't you think?
if you're the first person to guess where this picture was taken i pay you a beer, be it real or virtual :-)
hint: the picture was taken yesterday. i spent the whole day in z√ºrich, so this might narrow down your guessing possibilities a bit...
