i had to go in town (which is a nuisance on saturdays, but i had to get my prescription for the pain-killers...) and ended up in a [bookstore](http://www.jaeggi.ch/index_home.php) where they had a big sale, including a lot of dvd's.
so i not only ended up with a prescription for medicaments, but also with two new dvd's:
a deluxe 3 dvd edition of [spiderman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145487/) for 33 bucks (have you seen the [trailer for spiderman2](http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/spider-man_2/)?) and 
a amazing skiing movie: [global storming](http://dvd.mainseek.com/369R142P426_Global-Storming.html) for 20 bucks.

i peeked a bit at  [global storming](http://www.dvdretailshop.com/Global_Storming_6305701180.html), which makes me so much want to go and rent [those skis](http://www.getboards.com/snow/twintips/salomon/1080_171cm.html) and go skiing, but now i have to sit here and eat my pain killers, because skiing with broken ribs is such a no-go.
