i've had a quick look at my referers today.
  
they are mostly chock-full of referer-spam, so i don't really look at them too often.
  
but today, i noticed quite a bit of hits from a page on [hattrik.org](http://hattrick.org/). because some of my friends are quite fanactic hattrickers i thought someone linked to me and wanted to check back.
  
so i ended up on the site of the [sc hooligen](http://www49.hattrick.org/Common/teamDetails.asp?teamID=246125). at first i couldn't see a link to me, but a quick glance at the sourcecode revealed that the manager of said team hotlinked to an [image](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/Gurten04/Images/0_backup.jpg) i shot at the gurtenfestival 2004. i know that as soon as you release your images on the web it's extremely hard to track abuse of them [1], but hotlinking to a file is definitely a no-go!
  
so i thought, i'd do a little prank with the site, and replaced the image to something else.
  
i wonder how long it stays like that.



before on the left and after on the right.

**update: **everything is fine now, keep walking on, no need to stare.
  
but i hoped that he'd at least write me an email :-) and because i couldn't find one on the page that hosts the image now i'll just leave it here...
