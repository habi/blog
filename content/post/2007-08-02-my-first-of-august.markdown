it becomes more and more of a tradition, the yearly boatride at the [first of august](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schweizer_Nationalfeiertag). this year i took my camera with me, and time even managed to make a movie while jumping from the [auguet bridge](http://map.search.ch/muri-bei-bern?x=1328&y=1356&z=1024) as you can see below:


quite a funny face i make, what do you think?
if you want to judge the height a bit better, there's another movie of dan jumping off the bridge [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-d1tseX0nk). i've also made some images: they can be seen [here](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/sets/72157601180023273/show/), i just wanted to mention this image for the special jump i made: let's call it the floating buddha:
