did you ever play too much video games, so that you had nightmares? 
i remember once trying to finish tetris on the hardest possible setting on the gameboy and managing to finish it (so that the [space-shuttle bonus screen](http://www.cheatyourgame.com/cheats_gameboy/Tetris.htm) came up) and having the most terrible night-mares afterwards. i had to dodge out those falling blocks in my dreams, and every-time i couldn't manage it getting squished to death...

i bet [KeiicHi](http://mo-mus.com/mario.wmv) must have had nightmares, too (3.7 mb .wmv movie).
he manages to play the soundtrack of super mario land on his guitar, complete with the power-up and coin-grab sound effects! marvelous!
