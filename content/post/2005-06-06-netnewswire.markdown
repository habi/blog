i finally decided that it's worth upgrading [NetnewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) to the full version, mostly because of the [searching feature](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/featureschart20.php) and the [bloglines](http://bloglines.com/) synching. i just downloaded the demo now, which will work for 30 days from now on. anoyne else want to pay for that nice piece of software? because when we pay more than one license, then [each one pays 5$ less](https://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=2DQ), which makes it worth that post.
  
leave a comment or send me an email so we can license-pool...
