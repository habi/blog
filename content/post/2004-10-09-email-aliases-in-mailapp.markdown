i should have read [that post](http://www.justinfrench.com/index.php?id=47) before the suicmc04 was over!
i've been doing lot of emailing from all the different accounts @suicmc04.ch (info, sponsoring, race, helfer, etc.) and every-time i did this, i did an apple+; to go to the preferences of mail.app to be able change the corresponding email-address.
[![mail.app](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/mail.app-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/mail.app.jpg)now justin french (with [a wonderful website](http://www.justinfrench.com/)!) mentions an un-documented feature of mail.app. you are able to set up multiple adresses for one account, which is a HUGE timesaver for all of you that have multiple mail-addresses that are being forwarded to one address in the end (e.g john@example.com, john.doe@example.com, info@example.com). mail.app is even smart enough to know which address to use when you reply to an incoming mail.
just wonderful, but a pity i know it now that the suicmc is over and i won't be handling multi-alias mailing anytime soon.
stuff like this makes working with a mac even more fun!
