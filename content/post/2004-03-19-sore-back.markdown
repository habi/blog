oh, and just in case you wondered, i feel much better (unlike other [guys](http://flagr.antville.org/stories/727339/)). my back still hurts quite a bit and the muscles are sore like i've done 376397876 pushups, but it's on the way to getting better.
in the morning i visited my [osteopath](http://dict.leo.org/?p=TPi..&search=osteopathy) who told me that my back and all the other things are not in too bad of condition. he nearly broke my spine and next monday i'll go and see him again to decide when i (finally) can/should work again. (have you ever been manipulated by a osteopath? the sounds are mind-wrecking! but the feeling when you walk out of the doctor's practice makes you want to turn around and go in again :-)
