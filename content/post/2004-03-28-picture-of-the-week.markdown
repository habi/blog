i've been thinking about posting a picture per week for a really long time, and with the picture below i want to start that series. (kind of like the way [jeremy hedley](http://www.antipixel.com/blog/index.shtml) does). my pictures will probably never reach the artistic potential of the one's he posts, nonetheless i'll try to share some pictures i like with you
the picture below was this afternoon in the rosengarten here in bern.
hidden behind the tree is the cathedral, the mother on the right side of the tree was telling her kid stories for the whole time i was sitting there (around two hours) which i thought was really nice.
