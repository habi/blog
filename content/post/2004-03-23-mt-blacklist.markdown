i was not absolutely happy with [MT-Blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/) up to now, because i still get some comment from day to day.
but today i looked at my blog' activity log (if you run [MT](http://moveabletype.org/): /yourblog/mt.cgi?__mode=view_log ) and was quite astounded that my MT-Blacklist actually stops at least two spammers per day (!!!) from promoting their shabby site on my blog (and upping their ante in the google-page-ranks (as [discussed by b.](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/archives/000074.html)))
now i just updated my blacklist with [the master-blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/blacklist.txt) and am happy that [jay allen](http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/) protects me from the scum on the intaweb!
