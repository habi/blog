yesterday i helped a friend of mine to move. she owns an [original ball chair by aarnio eero](http://www.eero-aarnio.com/index.cfm/page/8/title/Ball_Chair.htm) which is quite a pain in the ass to move.
the picture below is the effort of five people to get that beast into the first floor (it's too wide to carry up stairs and too wide to get through doors.

i have to say that for me it looks like a scene from [Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080391/).
