after [some guy left gizmodo](http://www.engadget.com/) he founded [engadget](http://www.engadget.com/) to abandon himself to his gadget fetish.

the first entries on engadget (which is a really cool domain name, why do i never get those ideas :-) look really promising to fulfill my gadge-lust.
looks like i need to watch an rss-feed more!
