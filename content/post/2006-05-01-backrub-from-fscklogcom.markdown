today, fscklog posted something about [menushade](http://www.fscklog.com/2006/05/menushade_die_d.html), which i've been using together with [backdrop](http://www.johnhaney.com/backdrop/), when [i have to read something carefully](http://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/136308780/in/pool-cs3/) and cannot be distracted by anything.
  
to illustrate the way it works, leo used the image i submitted to the [cs3-pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/cs3/pool/) on flickr, a screenshot of my preparation for a job interview at the [psi](http://www.psi.ch/). [1]
  
i adapted this read-mode after [a post on 43folders](http://www.43folders.com/2006/04/17/fsm2-electric-boogaloo/), a gtd-freaks heaven.



[1]: the job would be in bern, at the anatomical institute, but i'd heavily work together with the people at the psi.
  
i'll let you know, when i know if they chose me...
