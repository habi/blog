[boinboing's link-fu-competition](http://boingboing.net/2004_01_01_archive.html#107461898444256062) is always a plethora of really weird stuff, but this one blows it all!

a [movie](http://jimmac.musichall.cz/stuff/Discofinska.mpeg) (probably czech according to the TLD, although the filename suggest that it's finnish) where a guy shows you how to dance "disco" really well. you absolutely have to watch [the whole movie](http://jimmac.musichall.cz/stuff/Discofinska.mpeg)  (6.8 mb mpeg), it's absoluhutely hilarious!
