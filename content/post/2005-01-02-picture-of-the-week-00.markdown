i wanted to (digitally) record the [ibrahim ferrer show](http://www.drs.ch/drsonline/gbgateinvoker.cfm?gbAction=drsContentFulldisplaySearchR&ObjectID=3A705107-CC18-4EEC-9E0B3D56FCD54DC1) that drs3 aired last thursday evening so the post about [enabling your ipod to record anything on hackaday](http://www.hackaday.com/entry/1234000147025394/) came just right. but after installing linux on my first-generation ipod  (see [here](http://www.dieselsweeties.com/shirts/index2.shtml)) with the extremely painless [ipodlinux installer](http://ipodlinuxinstl.sourceforge.net/) i could not get it to record more than 5 second snippets (but played some [games](http://www.ipodlinux.org/index.php/Screenshots) on it...) so i figured out an easier way. i started the live-stream of [drs3](http://www.drs.ch/indexdrs3.html) and used [wiretap](http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/)1 to record the concert. nonetheless i've now got two working operating systems on my ipod.

ps: now i just have to figure out how i can burn the 2h show on one cd to give to nina (which was the point from the beginning....)



1: the pro version works like a charm in the free mode as long as you don't need to record directly to mp3/aac. i used itunes for the conversion...
