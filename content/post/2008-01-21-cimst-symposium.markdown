[![I am a hard bloggin' scientist. Read the Manifesto.](http://www.hardbloggingscientists.de/logos/hardbloggin_normal.gif)](http://www.hardbloggingscientists.de/?page_id=14)the last few days were quite busy at work: i'm doing a block-course in "Biomaterials" at the ETHZ, starting today, so there was quite some catching up to do, and I also wanted to present a poster at the [CIMST-Symposium](http://www.cimst.ethz.ch/news/symposium) which takes place during the first two days of this blockcourse. next week I have another symposium and a talk in front of the whole institute covering the work I did in the last year. this means that I some quite long days, but the results so far are worth it.






    







  today I presented a poster [1] at the symposium which will serve me well at the symposium next week. since you've [seen](http://habi.gna.ch/2008/01/18/a4-statt-a0-2/) the poster already, you might also see it in full glory: Click the image below to see the poster (368kb .pdf) that I didn't manage to print on A0 until the third attempt.

(And no, it's not in full glory, but I don't think that you want to download a 13Mb pdf...)  

You might have seen that it links to a new section on my website: [habi.gna.ch/publications](http://habi.gna.ch/publications/). I want to try and post some more scientific stuff in future, including attempts of fraud and other funny stuff like automated paper generation. stay tuned!  

[1] the schooled eye might recognize it's [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/)-roots: [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) runs like a charm on Leopard, and [sciposter](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sciposter/) is very powerful!
