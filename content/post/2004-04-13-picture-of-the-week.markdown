the picture below was taken in the [american bar](http://www.vitruvio.ch/arc/contemporary/1880-1945/americanbar.php) in vienna, where it's actually prohibited to take pictures, so i had to take one without using the flash. the tables in the american bar are lit from within, leading to this amazing glowing bottles.
