i spent the past weekend with [renzo and eveline](http://team.gigathlon.ch/home/results_team_show.aspx?teamID=3259&resultview=0) which competed in the [gigathlon](http://www.gigathlon.ch/), a race [across switzerland](http://www.gigathlon.ch/DesktopDefault.aspx/tabid-965/1214_read-7829/) involving swimming, inline skating, road- and mountain-biking and running from locarno to basel via luzern. all the athletes and their supporters were housed in two camps, the picture below shows a panorama of the tents in the camp in airolo.

oh, and don't blame me for the barrel distortion, i was standing on a heap of scrap wood, while i took that panorama and feared that i'm gonna fall down, so i could not align the pictures any nicer...



**update:** all the pictures from the gigathlon can be found [here](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/Gigathlon05/).
