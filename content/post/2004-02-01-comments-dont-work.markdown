i know the comments don't work at all.
it's a problem with the update of MTBlacklist, i'm working on it.
good night.

**update**: after [b.](http://bernhardseefeld.ch/) did some of his touch-some-buttons-magic, the permissions on the server were set right, and i could update the two necessary files and everything now works like a charm, keep those comments flowing (i'm working on a funky feature concerning the comments...)
