well, if you're interested, one of the tandem movies [can be downloaded here](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/tandem_stream.mov).
i have to issue a warning, the file is about 9mb in size and if you got a weak stomach, then you might get ill :-)
further infos: the timeline of the movie is absolutely unedited, we drove down the [frickweg](http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&db=CH&GridE=829322&overviewmap=&client=public&advanced=&addr2=badgasse&addr3=bern&pc=&cname=Great+Britain&X=829322&GridN=5902073&Y=5902073&scale=5000&cidr_client=none&coordsys=mercator&place=BADGASSE,+3011,+BERN) with the speed you see on the movie (btw. [B.](http://bernhardseefeld.ch/) and [Hermann](http://armand.bild.li/), i could not show your house, because i had to concentrate on the sharp turn at the end of the [badgasse](http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&db=CH&GridE=829322&overviewmap=&client=public&advanced=&addr2=badgasse&addr3=bern&pc=&cname=Great+Britain&X=829322&GridN=5902073&Y=5902073&scale=5000&cidr_client=none&coordsys=mercator&place=BADGASSE,+3011,+BERN), sorry) and had exactly those two and something minutes to drive down. 
the annoying noise is the wind blowing in the microphone of my [cam](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydscp9/). remember it's supposed to take pictures, the movie-ability is just a nifty feature...
and yeah, gimme a break, i know the sound is not edited very thorough, but as i said [before](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000108.html), it's my first try with imovie.
