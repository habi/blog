[jan](http://pieceoplastic.com/index.php/2994/ruff-linkage-200725/) linked to it ages ago, yesterday evening i finally found the time to watch the "documentary about the current state of copyright and culture", quite a good movie where dj danger mouse, lawrence lessig and many more are interviewed.  
the movie sheds light on different ways of putting a copyright on movies/music and the like and is definitely worth your time. watch the full movie (59') below (tip to the hat to [blip.tv](http://blip.tv)) or download it via bittorent [here](http://www.goodcopybadcopy.net/download)...
