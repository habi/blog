that's what i wanted to do before i go to bed: here's my updated [cv](http://habi.gna.ch/cv/cv.html).
if you find a typo or a bug, then send me a quick note please.

**update**; the cv was done in Microsoft' Word, and i have to say that Word exports some f%รง&ed-up html code, i was cleaning the code up for about half an hour (i probably would have been faster writing the cv in html from scratch...)
