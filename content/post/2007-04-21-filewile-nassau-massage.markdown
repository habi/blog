[![Filewile-Nassau-Massage](http://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/filewile-nassau-massage-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/filewile-nassau-massage.jpg)andi and d√§nu aka [filewile](http://filewile.com/) released their second album called nassau massage (press release in [english](http://filewile.com/media/press/nassau_massage/INFO_MWCD003_E.pdf) or [german](http://filewile.com/media/press/nassau_massage/INFO_MWCD003_D.pdf)).
technically they release it in about a month, on the 25.5., but if you want to listen to it (like i've done [recently](http://www.last.fm/user/habi/charts/?charttype=recenttracks)), you can already [preorder](http://filewile.com/preorder/) it on their website, and expect a fast delivery. maybe not so fast as i did, 'cause i preordered the album on tuesday night, and andi dropped it in my mailbox on wednesday morning, together with the EP damn, to be released in a week :-)

so far, i really like the album a lot, all the songs are well groovy, some of them even have some radio-potential (as far as i can tell)... many songs feature great vocal artists like nicolette, mr. melody, rider shafique and also hometown hottie [baze](http://www.chlyklass.ch). if you get the cd, i recommend listening to  watch the vibe with mr. shafique (am i right, andi?) and communication, with a great old-school beat. and if you first want to listen to some other filewile-songs, you can download a bunch of them absolutely free [here](http://filewile.com/html/en/tracks_download/index.php). oh, and if you're hanging out on myspace, you can add them as a [friend](http://www.myspace.com/filewile), too. and if you want to buy some songs, they can be found in the [itunes music store](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtistSongs?sortMode=0&artistId=42569013).
