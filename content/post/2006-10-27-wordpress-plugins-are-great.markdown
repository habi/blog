[wordpress-plugins](http://wp-plugins.net/) are really neat!

i probably stumbled over lightboxJS a hundred times before. today i thought it would be really nice to have that for this site here. thanks to wordpress-plugins, implementing it here only took 4 steps:

- google [wordpress plugin lightboxJS](http://www.google.ch/search?hl=de&q=wordpress+plugin+lightboxJS&btnG=Google-Suche&meta=)
- download the plugin from [here](http://zeo.unic.net.my/notes/wp-lightbox-js-wordpress-plugin/)
- drop it into /wp-content/plugins
- activate the plugin in the control panel
and now, if you click on an image, you get the nice lightboxJS-effect. try it for yourself, maybe in the post below!
and if you read me only through my feed, this might be worth checking out the site...
