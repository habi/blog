<rap-mode>


cuz we're never losing a fight 
we keep it tight, featured site up at movable type 
I fill suckaz all over the blogosphere with dread 
[...]
next time you post about me, watch your trackback 
cuz I'm about to ping you with the real 
when a unicorn cries tell me how does it feel?
[...]
you think your tiny sucky blog makin me feel fear? 
I get more hits in a week than you get all year 
you cry a tear cuz you're jealous about my fame 
talk a good one but never call me out by name
