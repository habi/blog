i've updated my blog to [MT 3.2](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/) [1] and now i lost all my customizations to the sidebar and stuff like that [2]. good that i documented the odds and ends, so i might be able to rebuild it rather fast. in the moment you must bear with the rather terrible view on /blog when you visit in the browser. if you access my blog through the feed, you shouldn't notice a thing.
  
oh, and this is also a good opportunity to add some more plugins and bits and pieces here and there. for example, i updated the [root index.html](http://habi.gna.ch/) a bit [3] and deleted some unnecessary directories that were just lying around.



[1] mostly to get rid of the ever-increasing comment spam. lately not even the now deceased [MT-Blacklist](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/) was able to cope with it..,
  
[2] i shouldn't have "refreshed" the templates without thinking twice.
  
[3] no matter how you resize your browser window, the text is centered in it. done with some [css-tweakery](http://www.infinitypages.com/research/cssverticalcentereddiv.htm)
