following up [my entry of yesterday evening](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000129.html) here's a link for all of you to enjoy: a [website](http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p1/src/sing/default.asp?key=83j5ARjO) that takes the words you want as an input, converts them to a song. that song consisting of sampled words of some other songs.
i at have at least three of the words from my example in my own library.

rhytm - rhythm of the dancer from snap!
true - digital love from daft punk
fun - [perfect day from lou reed](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=1505086&selectedItemId=1504951) (the other ones cannot be found on ITMS...)

hmm, that could become a contest, post your song to recognize in the comments! (you can send the song to your email to get the direct link to it.) or do you recognize more samples than i do in my song?
