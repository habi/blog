you might have seen [that flickr photoset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/28129213@N00/sets/181299) which was linked from [boingboing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/23/rfid_self_implant_fo.html) last week. a guy implanted a rfid chip in his hand to do different stuff with it, like opening a door lock, or starting his car. sounds crazy? it is, but it's that kind of stuff i like. just imagine how cool it would be to touch the handlebar of your bike and it's unlocked in that very same moment. no fiddling with keys and anything.
  
privacy concerns? not really, because the implant cannot be read if more than some inches away, which is surely the distance one would notice
  
now [shannon](http://www.zentastic.com/) posted [an interview with Amal](http://www.bmezine.com/news/presenttense/20050330.html) over at the [bmezine](http://www.bmezine.com/).  go and read it, it's enlightening (or think what you want of it).
