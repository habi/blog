when i take a look at my [referres](http://habi.gna.ch/usage/referers.html) (or inbound links) then something amazes me:
why am i [the first hit at google.ch](http://www.google.ch/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=ipod+mini&btnG=Google+Search&meta=cr%3DcountryCH) when someone looks for the [ipod mini](http://www.apple.com/ipodmini/)?

(besides that the referrers are full of spam...)

[kinda via [flagrant](http://flagr.antville.org/stories/668160/), which made me look at my referrers]
