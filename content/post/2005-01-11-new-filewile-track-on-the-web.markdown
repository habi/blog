dustbowl and deejot have released a new track. this time they did not release it on their page, but on the [alpinechic-label](http://www.alpinechic.net). you can grab the whole compilation SWISS CIRCUS IN STEREO Compilation #2 as one big zip-file [here](http://www.alpinechic.net/ac/zip/ac011.zip) (84.6mb .zip) or only the filewile-track Attila [here](http://www.alpinechic.net/ac/mp3/ac011-05_filewile-attila.mp3) (7.59mb .mp3).



oh, and sigi. now you've got one of those [shiny gadgets](http://www.apple.com/ipod/), you can just point your podcast application (i suggest [ipodder](http://ipodder.sourceforge.net/)) to the [podcast-link](http://filewile.com/podcast.php) of filewile, and you magically get all their songs...
