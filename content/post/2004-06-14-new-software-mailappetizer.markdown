[![screenshot_large](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/screenshot_large-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/screenshot_large.png)[leo's fscklog](http://fscklog.typepad.com/fsck/) is always a good place to discover new software (sometimes i wonder where he takes the time to fill all his [MacOrama's](http://fscklog.typepad.com/fsck/2004/06/macorama_fr_den_9.html) with interesting news).
[mail.appetizer](http://www.bronsonbeta.com/mailappetizer/) is an excellent freeware application (see [leos german explanation](http://fscklog.typepad.com/fsck/2004/01/freeware_mailap.html)) which alerts you with a customizable window when any new mail arrives in any of your inboxes in mail.app.
so you can preview your incoming mail and decide if it's worth switching to mail or carry on with the task you've been doing at the moment.
RC3 of mail.appetizer got even better, now the window is completely customizable, e.g. the font and size can be chosen and it also displays the sender picture (from the [addressbook](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/addressbook/)) so you get a hint on who you want's to steal your time.
an indispensable piece of software!
