my selfmade pizza is in the oven and will be ready exactly when the [live-movie](http://www.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/24/0,1872,2205144,00.html) starts (sorry, the link is only available in german).
i can hardly remember the last time i spent an evening in front of the telly watching normal television, i've been watching a lot of dvds lately, but not a live program, so this is gonna be fun.
have a nice evening!

[read more](http://www.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/26/0,1872,2202586,00.html) about the live-movie project on [zdf.de](http://www.zdf.de/)

**update:** the movie was quite good - although i don't really like murder mystery stories. while fun to watch the slight errors which occurred through the live-format (delayed appearances of actors, some shaky cameras and two or three times reflections of the camera-team in the well-lit windows) the achievements of the whole team were really impressive. if you want to see a bit more, then zdf has a [little after-documentary](http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmt/mediathek/0,3496,MT-2206834,00.html) on its website.
