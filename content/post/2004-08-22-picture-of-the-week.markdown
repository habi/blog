the grand-raid was really exhausting. renzo and me underestimated how hard it can get to ride 76 km on a tandem.
the picture below shows the profile of the race (which we finished as tenth of eleven tandems). we started from Heremence and drove to Grimentz.

**update**: datasport has put the results of the grand-raid online. [click here](http://www.services.datasport.com/2004/mtb/grandraid/ALFAE.HTM) to see how renzo and me finished (look for CTan in the lower part of the page). 10 hours and 12 minutes and a mean velocity of 7.5 km/h, how pathetic :-)

from the 6th september on you might be able to see pictures of our effort online at the [fotolaboclub](http://www.fotolaboonlinealbum.ch/altiapp/amp/amp.fcg?LOGIN=&name=grandraid&password=cristalp&language=french). i have no idea how it's gonna work. in any case, we've been riding with the number 7005, this might help to search for pictures...
