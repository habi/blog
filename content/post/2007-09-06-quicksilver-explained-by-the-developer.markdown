some people still can get their mind around [quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/) [1].
funnily enough i've been using this magnificent piece of code since pretty much exactly [three years](http://habi.gna.ch/2004/04/07/new-software/). it's really hard to explain to someone who just scratched the surface of it, it's a launcher, [hotkey-listener](http://lifehacker.com/software/hack-attack/nine-time+saving-quicksilver-triggers-291520.php), file-mangler, email-preparer, copy-paste-helper, history-catcher, address-book-search-engine and much, much more. A1c0r, the developer of quicksilver recently made a talk about the inner workings of his software at google [2].
so if you still need a push, then watch the video below in it's full length, it's very worth it.



[via [43 folders](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/43Folders/~3/152648955/)], where merlin mann also links to an [episode of macbreak](http://www.twit.tv/mb12) where quicksilver was dicussed...

[1]: yes [matthias](http://metablog.ch/), i'm looking towards you :-) (put more than one nerd who uses quicksilver [around a table](http://metablog.ch/archives/2007/09/04/velocontent-im-alten-tramdepot/), pretty soon someone talks about how 'that' could be done much easier with [quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/). this monday we've talked about how cool something like this would be on a [mobile phone](http://openmoko.org/). i would not get an iphone for it, that's for sure!)
[2]: it's not totally clear, but i suppose he's a google-employee.
