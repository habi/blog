today i was again at a photo-shooting. a [customer](http://www.polyconsult.ch/) of the velokurier was looking for a model which was willing to show his ass to two old ladies (really!)
the idea is that the [ewb](http://www.ewb.ch/ww/de/pub/index.htm), the energy and water supplier of bern is providing everyone with energy here in bern (their slogan is "we pass on our energy"). the setup was like this: a messenger fills his water-bottle at one of[ the fountains in bern](http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&c2coff=1&q=brunnen+bern&btnG=Search). two elderly ladies pass and watch his nice butt. since we all have nice butts they were looking for one of us who had time tonight.
since the ad-agency preferred me to [urs](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/Passfahrt/Images/22.jpg) and [renzo](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/SUICMC03/Pages/23.html) (urs has the wrong length of hair and they didn't see renzos butt or the would have chosen him :-) i will be on that ad which comes out sometimes in november/december this year. it was quite annoying to stand there in full autumn-gear while the sun is shining down pretty strong. and both ladies were only marginally funny while they tried to make jokes about my butt so they would loosen up a bit for the pictures. we'll see how the poster will turn out.

but with the money i got from that shooting and the [last one](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000398.html) i'll finally be able to replace my broken [chair](http://images.google.com/images?q=panton%20chair&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&c2coff=1&sa=N&tab=wi)! (the perfect birthday gift from me to myself...)
