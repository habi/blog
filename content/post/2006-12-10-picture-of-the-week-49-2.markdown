we've spent a wonderful weekend in [leukerbad](http://leukerbad.ch). since half of italy spent their long weekend in switzerland every hotelroom was booked [1]. so we spent the night in the marvellous [schlosshotel in leuk](http://schlosshotel-leuk.ch/), some kilometers down the road.
if you ever want to spend the night in a nice hotel [2] we can recommend it. the beds are so comfortable that you don't want to leave them, even not for brushing your teeth and making a phonecall :-)

[1]: three single beds were free in whole leukerbad, but we didn't want that
[2]: that is also quite cheap and is run by people with disabilities - as an integration project and place to live
