if you cannot be without the dock magnification effect, then you abolutely must start to use [google X](http://labs.google.com/googlex/) from now on. quite nifty!

**update:** the site is gone. it was a nifty dhtml-emulation of the dock magnification effect on google which made it "easy" to switch between the different parts of google (imgages.google.com, video.google.com, groups.google.com, etc.)
