[![Ax](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/ax-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/ax.jpg)ok, i admit, i could also have bought a really long (but marginally less expensive) cable, but i has got me an [airport express](http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/) from [ricardo](http://www.ricardo.ch/) [1].



now i can play all my tunes [2] over my bad-ass stereo with b&o loudspeakers, much better than the puny logitech speakers :-) and if i'd actually had a printer, i could print wireless, but that's another story. now i just need another wireless enabled gadget to fully use this new one.


  

[1]: i prefer using it to ebay, it seems less scam-ridden...
  
[2]: currently 2624 songs, 11.21 GB
