sunday evening i went to see [the return of the king](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/), which was really good.
it's amazing what [the guys behind the computer](http://www.wetadigital.com/) achieved in that movie.
one of the scenes made the crowd in the [cinema](http://www.kitag.com/infocenter/kinos/info.php?cinemaId=614785) applause spontaneously: [legolas](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089217/) takes down one of those [gigantomaniac war-elephants](http://www.wetafx.co.nz/workshop/pastprojects/large/lotr_lg.htm) in such an elegant way that leaves you absolutely breathless!
a wonderful, energetic wrapping of real-film with amazing cgi.
if you've seen the first two episodes, then the third is a must, if you haven't you spend most of your time in bed, so it's no big deal to you anyway :-)

**btw**: even the guys over at [gearbits](http://www.gearbits.com/archives/000439.html) like the movie.
