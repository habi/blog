this week was really busy, i was giving computer science lessons in [kirchberg](http://www.schule-kirchberg.ch/) while still working nearly normally.

luckily i was rewarded with the nicest afternoon at work during [this week full of snow](http://velocite.ch/weblogtoo/index.php?p=73), so i only biked privately in the snow.

the picture below is from one evening, coming home. riding fast even with a lot of snow on the street.
