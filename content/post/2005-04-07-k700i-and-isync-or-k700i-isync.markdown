yesterday i went to prolong my contract with my mobile phone provider, so i was able to cheaply get a new mobile phone. after looking at the different mobiles [compatible with isync](http://www.apple.com/isync/devices.html) i decided (mostly for monetary reasons) to get the [Sony Ericsson K700i](http://www.sonyericsson.com/k700/).
  
after trying to sync it with my computer i nearly gave up, because isync always crashed on me in the middle of the syncing process. after countless tries, deleting preference files, rewriting some preinstalled bundles and stuff like that isync notified me of a "duplication warning" with one contact i have in my address-book: the godfather of my sister is in my address book as: Renner Prename & Prename Wife.
  
that puny little ampersand made my isync crash every time. after i've edited the contact to "Renner Prename1 Prename2" everything worked like a charm.
  
just in case anyone out there has the same problem and is trying to find a solution...



[![Btk700I](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/btk700i-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/btk700i.jpg)now i just need to get file transfers going, that's also a thing that doesn't work. the transfer starts just right, but then dies with the error seen on the left. i can send files from the phone to the mac, but not the other way. really weird!
  
anyone any suggestions on how to remedy that situation, 'cause i'd really like to use a cool .mp3 as a ringtone...
