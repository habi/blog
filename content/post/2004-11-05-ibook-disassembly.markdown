after i partially unscrewed my ibook last night i gave up at two o'clock in the morning (mostly because i was too tired to go on and couldn't see the screws anymore :-)
then this morning i found [this](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/files/iBook500HDRev1.2.pdf) detailed pdf (1mb) in which cybergreg nicely explains how to replace the internal hdd of an ibook.
so i just need to grab one of these really small screwdrivers and give it another go...
