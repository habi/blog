[osxhints](http://www.macosxhints.com/) made that little [hint on Descent2](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040527005641179), that has brought me back to old ages.
if you've never played descent2, then you don't need to bother actually clicking on the link, but if you spent countless hours in front of a glooming monitor trying to master your spaceship while zapping through complicated tunnels and blasting the enemies with CONCSN MISSILE's, then you absolutely need to!
i think Descent2 was the best 3d-mission game, i remember playing it for hours (i think that was actually one of the few computer-games i played more than two times or so, i never was a gamer...). i cannot wait to actually finish a level and be blasted out of the mother-spaceship.
[miklos](http://kozary.com/mt/) and [b.](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/) do you remember?
flashback ahoi!
