during the past few weeks i've been thinking about the panorama i've shot of the [baldachin near the railway-station](http://habi.gna.ch/2009/02/22/ein-samstag-nachmittag-in-der-stadt/) here in bern. i've thought it would be very nice to have a nightly version of the same panorama. so, yesterday evening i again spent some time on the bubenbergplatz and shot quite a bunch of images. i've had two lenses with me, the newly aquired [16mm zenitar fisheye](http://www.kenrockwell.com/zenit/zenitar-16mm.htm) which makes shooting panoramas a breeze, since the FOV is so big, but is actually quite a hassle to setup, since it's a fully manual lens, so more suited for this task than for snapshots. in addition to the zenitar i've had my trusty 38-80mm zoom lens




the first results from my mini-photo-safari can be seen in this set [here on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/sets/72157618981051701/). most of the images are shot with the zenitar, but the important one is shown here below:

the image is humongous (600 kB), so you need to wait a little bit until it loads. to close the pop-up, scroll toward the far right!




again, it's a panorama, this time shot and composed from 123 images in total (really!). all the images have been taken yesterday evening from 21:35 until 21:45, so if the setup is good, you can shoot a panorama like that in 10 minutes, including waiting time until all the cars, busses and trams are where you want them...




the panorama is - again, as the one shot about three months ago in the afternoon - composed from three exposures for each position, hence i've covered the field of view with 41 images and fused the images down to one enhanced exposure with [enfuse](http://enblend.sourceforge.net/) built into [hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/).




i really need to get a nice very wide angle lens, since shooting panoramas with the zenitar is really a breeze, apart from the manual setup. [this panorama](http://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/3579181827/) has been composed from only three images and looks already quite impressive. really impressive - in my opinion anyways - is that shooting a full 360Â° panorama of the bubenbergplatz only requires 10 images and about one and a half minute and can be seen below (444 kB):

the full 360Â°-panorama is of course much nicer in the fully interactive view, provided [here](http://habi.gna.ch/panoramas/bubenbergplatz.html).
