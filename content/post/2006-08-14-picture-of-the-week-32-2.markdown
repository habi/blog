this weekend ninas [brother](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/andi/) got married to [karin](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/karin/). they planned a big party in their garden, but unfortunately the weather was a bit more like november than august. so they had to last-minute-reschedule the whole wedding to a restaurant. in the end everything turned out really great, and the party ended quite early in the morning. a wedding to remember; congratulations karin and andi!

i didn't take that many pictures, but if you want to look at them, you can do so [here](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/andi/):

and i'd like to mention one of the images, mostly because nina looked really wonderful in her skirt. see for yourself here:
