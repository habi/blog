'cause they now come with [tetris](http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1101). i'm now really gonna buy a new one. or shall i wait 'till after [wwdc](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) next monday?

**update: **hm, [raph](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=614) just told me that [ipodlinux](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000510.html) now comes with tetris (it didn't in january...), so i might just wait a litlle bit more....

**2nd update: **wow! [pt](http://makezine.com/) just managed to view [videos on an ipod](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/06/play_videos_on.html). this leaves for some speculation. see [here](http://ipodlinux.org/Video_Player) for more info on this.
