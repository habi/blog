in the tradition of [pinguin.swf](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=penguin.swf&spell=1) here's another extremely silly but annoyingly addictive flash-game: [blow up the warthog](http://www.collegemix.com/content.php?q=2&id=522&action=previous) to kill all the bad aliens.

oh, and by the way: do you know the successor of pinguin.swf [orca slap](http://62.116.30.116/index.html)?
