[filewile](http://www.filewile.com/filewile.php) ([andi](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/Filewile/Pages/17.html)'s and dejot's mobile laptop duo) put up a [new track](http://www.filewile.com/html/index.php) for you to download, a remix for [scream](http://screamonline.ch/).
i don't really like scream, so i think i have to listen to the song at least twice, but as you can see, it's on my [playlist](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/itunes/last30.html).
yes, i know that [MTAmazon](http://mtamazon.sourceforge.net/) does a bad job at finding the right picture for filewile, but i cannot do anything about it...
