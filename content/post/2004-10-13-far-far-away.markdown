i'm on the [weissfluhjoch](http://www.slf.ch/images/wfj-gr.jpg) to visit [sigi](http://www.slf.ch/staff/pers-home/sigrist/sigrist-en.html) until sunday, so you might not want to expect any updates here.

i just came back from [the vernissage of urs' new book](http://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/sets/22039/) where [he](http://suicmc04.ch/pictures/brunch_gurnigel/pages/page_37.html) read some parts from [his first novel: luchs](http://bilgerverlag.ch/index.php/trade/productview/66/39/) (the german word for [lynx](http://images.google.com/images?q=lynx&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)). 
since it's gonna be a long train-ride to davos i'm gonna take the plunge into his work and know a lot more about the current lynx-debate in the upper [simmental](http://images.google.com/images?q=lynx&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).
