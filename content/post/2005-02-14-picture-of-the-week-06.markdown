i spent the weekend in [lech](http://www.lech-zuers.at/Default.asp) with mara. we thought we'd go skiing a lot, but then it turned out to be really bad weather. on saturday it rained heavily and yesterday there was quite a lot of snow (they closed the road leading to lech just after we left, so we were pretty much the last ones to get out of there...). the picture below shows the view on the slopes yesterday :-)
