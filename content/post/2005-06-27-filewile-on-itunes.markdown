[dejot and dustbowl](http://filewile.com/) released a new track today. you can grab their remix of sunnydays from melody & rider [here](http://filewile.com/html/en/tracks_download/index.php). it's another pay per listen release, 'cause those laptop jugglers need to make some cash, too... (and a dollar is not too much, innit?)
  
if you don't want to pay through paypal or finetunes, then you have to wait a bit, until the other songs are released on itunes, for the moment you can only get the [barbarella-ep](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?artistId=42569013) and [emitow](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?artistId=42569013) from the CCCC IV-sampler in the ITMS. other songs will follow, for sure.
