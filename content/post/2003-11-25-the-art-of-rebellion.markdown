yesterday i read a review of "the art of rebellion", today i surfed on [their page](http://www.the-art-of-rebellion.com/) and instantly [bought that book](http://www.buchkatalog.de/kod-bin/isuche.cgi?aktion=fullprintview&TI=art+of+rebellion&sortby=&bereich1=1-1&navigaktiv=ja).
looks like a really good book to read ([1.5mb pdf-preview](http://www.the-art-of-rebellion.com/)) or just simply to look at. i can hardly wait until the postman rings twice...

btw: go to page 7 in the pdf, there you can see invader from france. can you remember where in bern that he put up his invaders? (in the [munstergasse](http://www.bern-altstadt.ch/livecam/) and at least two in the [matte](http://matte.ch/)...)
