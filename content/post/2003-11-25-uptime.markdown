well, my ibook [has been up for 14 hours](http://uptimes.hostingwired.com/account.php?op=details&hid=8399) since the last reboot (had to reboot after my first kernel panic; unplugged the bluetoothmodule after update of bluetooth software through software update). 
now i go to bed and have a good night's sleep.

here's a funky image with my uptime:![](http://uptimes.hostingwired.com/remote.php?hostid=8399&bgcolor=000000&color=ffffff)
