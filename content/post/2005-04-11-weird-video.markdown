[![Belinda](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/belinda-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/belinda.jpg)if you'd like to start your week wirh a really weird video, then you might want to step over to [pieceoplastic.com](http://pieceoplastic.com/). [jan posted](http://pieceoplastic.com/index.php/1764/rebell-tv/) a link to a video of [belinda bedekovic](http://www.belindabedekovic.com/) who plays a weird instrument really weird. you can either watch the video as [a flash-file](http://www.belindabedekovic.com/video_fl_en.htm) or download the [32mb divx-encoded .avi](http://www.belindabedekovic.com/Tornado.avi). quicktime refuse to play it, so you might want to grab [vlc](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/), which is always the best candidate for those weirdo videos (and all formats :-).



as jan said it: holy mackerel!!!!
