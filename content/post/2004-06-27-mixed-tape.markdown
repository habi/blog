mercedes benz (yes, the [car maker](http://www.mercedes-benz.com/)) has released 15 nice tracks as mp3's for your pleasure, you can download them for free and they all add up to a [mixed tape](http://www.mixed-tape.com/).
a 60 minutes collection of downbeaty, ambient and jazzy tunes, with one song especially produced to announce the new cls-class of mercedes-benz.
if this is the new form of marketing, i'm all up to it. and there's even a second collection coming up, sometimes in the beginning of august.

[via somewhere i forgot, but [elbewerk](http://elbewerk.com/2004/06/pods-auf-rdern.shtml) also blogs it.]

ps: elbewerk also post the direct link to a [90mb .zip-file](http://audio.mb.s-v.de/modules/mod_dl.php?lang=en&cover=1&tracks=all) which includes all songs.
