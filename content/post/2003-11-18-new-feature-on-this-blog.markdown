i was reading some more about [trackback](http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/) some days ago (which still is a bit too much for my puny little head to fully get the point).  

well, the thing is that some guys proposed to the trackback abilty of [movable type](http://www.movabletype.org/) to post songs from [winamp](http://www.winamp.com/), then another guy followed up with pretty much exactly the same for [itunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) (btw, also quite good for window...).  

the approaches used a special applescript which i could not get to work (even with the help of [l33t](http://www.geocities.com/mnstr_2000/translate.html) [b.](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/) :-)  

after hours of debugging and timeless rebuilding of my blogs index files i googled for another solution, which comes in the form of [kung-tunes](http://www.kung-foo.tv/itti.php) (clearly a sibling of [kung-log](http://www.kung-foo.tv/kunglog.php), which i rely on to maintain my blog).   

the solution is actually not any different than with the applescript, but kung-tunes has a [GUI](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=GUI) which i found out to heavily rely on.  

but  there was even some more debugging needed and quite a long discussion over [fire](http://fire.sourceforge.net/) with [berni](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/), which led to the final result (with again some l33t coding snippets flying through the ether) to the new category on the sidebar.   

you can now see what five songs my itunes played in the last few minutes. including links to the [ITMS](http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/) (where you can only buy the song if you are in the us of a-land, but a preview is availiable from everywhere) and cover-art from [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) (if available).   

an interesting point of view if you want to know what rocks my socks.
  

if you want only to see the songs, and not read my babble all day long, then you can [click here](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/ipod/now_playing.html), there sits the file that gets included into the sidebar through some php-magic.  


resources: 


	
  * this was the entry on [quiet confusion](http://www.quietconfusion.com/2003/07/blogtunes.php) that started it all.

	
  * the final solution to my problem came from [erichs blog](http://www.s-phase.com/blog01/archive01/000052.html)

	
  * where he links to the [kung-tunes authors blog entry](http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000484.php) which was quite helpful, too

	

now there's only one problem: as i have quite a buch of swiss music. amazon is not very good at finding these covers. maybe there's a way to retrieve the covers from [cede.ch](http://www1.cede.ch/), but that's a task for some other day.  

and with the ability to post all the played songs the creation of an online habi-hitparade or a "this song was played least"-page seems not too far off. ah, i look forward to all these cold winter evenings :-)
  

good night!  
  
  



oh and by the way: i'm listening to [Xtremes](http://www1.cede.ch/covers/mp3/352000/352216_1_8.mp3) from the album [Billy Bear by Stress](http://www1.cede.ch/de/music-cd/frames/frameset.cfm?aobj=352216) while typing this entry, which is a cd you have to buy if you haven't jet!
