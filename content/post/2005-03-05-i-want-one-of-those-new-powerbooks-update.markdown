the newest revision of apples powerbooks features an accelerometer, that detects if you drop the powerbook and parks the hard disc heads (a thing already found on older ibm-machines). now [a guy figured out](http://www.kernelthread.com/software/ams/) how to tap into the accelerometer and use it to display all kind of funky stuff (e.g. a window is fixed in space, while the powerbook rotates). this led [another guy to program a python script](http://interconnected.org/home/2005/03/04/apples_powerbook) whith which you can control itunes. just give your powerbook a mild slap on the head and it switches to the next song. i see some really funky stuff coming up for those powerbooks....

**update: **someone already did program [a game for the tilt sensors](http://www.balooba.se/baloobasoftware/texts/bubblegym.htm). let the fun begin.
