i've installed [wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) 4 months ago and have to say that i'm really happy with it. [1]
]wordpress has a big bunch of useful plugins and seems to run with much less resources on the server than my old cms, [movable type](http://www.movabletype.org/). and the best thing is that wordpress has a really great comment spam filter built in, [akismet](http://akismet.com/). today, akismet caught it's 10000th spammy comment.
to celebrate this, i'm featuring the comment here (as an image, let's not get too exited and give them google-credits:-)
