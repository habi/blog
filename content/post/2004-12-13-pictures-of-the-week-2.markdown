[![Dsc04020](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC04020-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC04020.jpg)the pictures from my vacation on sharm el sheik last week are now online in[ the pictures-section](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/Sharm/). those available are the ones i shot above sealevel, the ones below are old-fashioned analog ones, so they will take some time go come. (i cannot wait to see the ones i shot on the [thistlegorm](http://www.touregypt.net/vdc/Thistle.htm), this was the most amazing dive in my short diving career!)
