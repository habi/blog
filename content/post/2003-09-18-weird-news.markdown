[this](http://www.mobiletracker.net/archives/2003/09/17/att_wireless_pu.php) sounds a bit strange for me: i knew that text messages are not the hype-thing in the us of a, but that it's considered big news by [mobiletracker](http://www.mobiletracker.net/), that one can send SMS to other countries does sound a bit like oldfashioned news indeed...

btw: read [this entry](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/008859.php#008859) on [gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/) for another view on this :-)
