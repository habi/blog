[![Multitouch](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/multitouch-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/multitouch.jpg)it is [rumored](http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0602videoipod.html) that the next iteration of the ipod will feature a nice screen with a 3.5"-touchscreen and a digital scrollwheel.
  
however cool that may be, i was really impressed by that tech-demo from the new york university here: [bi-manual, multi-point, and multi-user input on a graphical interaction surface](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~jhan/ftirtouch/). it shows how one would be able to interact with an OS/GUI with multiple fingers and two hands. wicked!
  
you can directly grab the demo reel as a [17 mb .mpg-file](http://mrl.nyu.edu.nyud.net:8090/~jhan/ftirtouch/multitouchreel.mpg) or [12mb .mp4-file](http://mrl.nyu.edu.nyud.net:8090/~jhan/ftirtouch/multitouchreel.mp4) (both linked in the [coral-cache](http://www.coralcdn.org/)-version to save some bandwidth).
