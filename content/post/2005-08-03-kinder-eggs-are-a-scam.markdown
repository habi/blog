[![Dsc01118](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC01118-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC01118.jpg)past saturday i went to the migros to buy some stuff for my weekend. and just because we had acute chocolate craving, nina and me bought two [kinder eggs](http://images.google.com/images?q=kinder+egg&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) at the checkout. when i opened mine back home, i was quite stunned that there was a little car in it (which is not really stunning per se). the car was a [smart forfour](http://images.google.com/images?q=smart+forfour&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) which consisted of four parts, so it was not even a challenge to put the thing together. since when do they put advertisement into chocolate?



but the best thing comes now: when nina opened her egg, she had exactly the same thing in it. what a scam! not only do they put paid advertisment into the eggs (see image), they also flood you with it.
  
next time we're gonna buy [real chocolate](http://images.google.com/images?q=m-budget+schokolade&btnG=Search&svnum=10&hl=en&lr=).



ps: you also get a special code in the eggs which should enable you to unlock a special thing on the [kinder egg](http://magic-kinder.com/) site, but i couldn't open it (neither in safari or camino...). guess there are no kids with os x out there :-)



ps2: don't dare to look up "m-budget" on images.google.com (e.g. don't click [here](http://images.google.com/images?q=m-budget&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)) if you can't handle sexually explicit material...
