whoever follows me on [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/notice/878390) (or on facebook for that matter) knows that i've spent a noon lying in a tight and noisy tube. at the inselspital they're always looking for gunia pigs for [mri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI)-studies, and i've been there (for the [second time](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/2071160155/) now). the reward you get afterwards is a dvd with the images of your bodypart they imaged, the last time it was my head, now - since they're working on spectroscopy of the heart muscle - i got images of my beating heart and my torso.




and since there is a wonderful free [dicom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicom)-viewer for the apple platform, [osirix](http://www.osirix-viewer.com/), i've tried to make some nice videos of my inner workings. so without much further ado, here's the videos:




my beating heart, axial view:







my beating heart, sagittal view:







a little fly-around of my torso:







all the images have been made with double triggering, once a trigger for breathing, to compensate for the motion of the internal organs, and on top of that with a trigger on the heart-beats, to actally be able to image a full beating sequence of my heart. the funny thing is, that the people that performed the study had to ask me to breathe a bit faster, since one imaging cycle took them so long :)




oh, and BTW: here's [one video and one view of my head](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/head/). whoever tells my the reason that a piece on the back of my skull is missing wins a price.
