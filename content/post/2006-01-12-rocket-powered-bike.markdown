sometimes later in the afternoon at work i wish for something like [this](http://www.popsci.com/popsci/how20/f5dec714c2648010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html). a rocket bike with a rather impressive acceleration, from 0 to 96 km/h in five (!!!) seconds.
  
the bike where the rocket is bolted on looks a bit goofy, but i guess you could improve that easily...
  
now i just want to see a video of it in action!
