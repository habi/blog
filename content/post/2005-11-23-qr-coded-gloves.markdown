[![Dsc02420](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC02420-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC02420.jpg)this afternoon i went to buy some gloves (it's getting cold at work you know :-).



coming home i noticed that they have a normal label and a supplementary [qr code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code) ([german](http://circle.ch/blog/p1773.html)) sewn into them. since i couldn't find a decoder for os x (the java-version of the one [urs [1] found](http://circle.ch/blog/p1774.html) doesn't work for me), i kindly ask the blogosphere if they can decode it for me.
  
i'm just wondering what adidas is writing in my gloves.



additional images (and an [extreme closeup](http://www.flickr.com/photos/habi/66206907/)) can be found on [my flickr-page](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/tags/qrcode/) tagged accordingly.
