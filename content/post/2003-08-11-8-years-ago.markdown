8 years ago this week, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) launched the war between the browsers (was there any other than netscape back then) with the release of the first version of the [Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/).  


guess who won the war?  

but there are still some fighters left (at least on windows-platforms)  




	
  * [mozilla](http://www.mozilla.com), also with its [firebird](http://www.mozilla.com/firebird)

	
  * [opera](http://www.opera.com)


  * [netscape](http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/) (does this still count?)



on [os x ](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)microsoft stopped the development of IE, because they had to admit, that [apple](http://www.apple.com/) has a more advanced product: [safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) (mostly because they knew how to tie it into the OS :-)
