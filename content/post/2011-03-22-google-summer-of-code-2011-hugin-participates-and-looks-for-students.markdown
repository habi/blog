Readers of this blog might know that I'm an avid user of [hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/). Like every year since 2007, hugin participates in the [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/), a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects. In the past years [Yuval Levy](http://panospace.wordpress.com/) and [Alexandre Prokudine](http://prokoudine.info/) [0] spearheaded the GSoC effort for hugin.




Since I'm no programmer I wanted to give back something to the community and will act as this years main admin, while [Bruno Postle](http://www.bruno.postle.net/) will act as a backup.




So, if you know a student that would like to participate in a neat, C and C++-based project this summer, let her or him know about our mentoring page for GSoC: [Hugin - Panorama Photo Stitcher](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/show/google/gsoc2011/hugin)




And just to be complete: The text below just went to the [hugin mailing list](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/hugin-ptx), the call for Students.




[0]: Now of [darktable](http://darktable.sourceforge.net/)-fame, as seen [here](http://prokoudine.info/blog/2011/03/darktable-in-gsoc2011/).
