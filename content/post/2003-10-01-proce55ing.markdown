well, i have to admit, that [Proce55ing](http://www.proce55ing.net/) looks like the next thing to be with graphical fooling around on the net. 
check out the sourcecode of [this example](http://www.proce55ing.net/learning/examples/storing_input.html), it's amazingly lightweight!

(i read a nice article in the [latest](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/) [wired](http://www.wired.com/), and thought, i'd check out the site, it really looks like it's got the ability to beat [flash](http://www.macromedia.com/) and all else...)
