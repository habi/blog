after we had [two performances](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/archives/000705.html) in a row on saturday i drove all the way up to [eywald](http://map.search.ch/eywald?z=64) to our new years eve-party. the conditions on the road were a bit tricky, so i arrived just in time for a toast to the new year.
  
the picture below shows me and nina with some sparkles. i really hope that we have a lot more of them in the new year!
