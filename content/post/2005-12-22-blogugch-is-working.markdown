after some heated debates about opml-files and licensing problems (which i've not taken part in) there's a new open swiss weblog directory, where every blogging person should add their feed. as far as i understand it, it's supposed to become a complete repository of all swiss feeds, where people then can build services with it (aggregators and other tools).



[jan](http://pieceoplastic.com/index.php/2134/blogugch-is-functional/) has a short rundown, [chregu](http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/2005/12/21/blogug-ch.html) has a more thorough post, also explaining the [ping-service](http://ping.blogug.ch/). i've added a blogug.ch-button to my sidebar (it used to be sub.scribe.to for some days...) and time will tell if it's gonna kick in...



as far as i found out, [MT](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/)-users can ping by going to their /mt.cgi, to general settings of the weblog in question (in the sidebar under settings) and then to "new entry defaults". there you have to add "http://ping.blogug.ch" to "Publicity/Remote Interfaces".



in ecto [1] just go to "weblog" > "edit settings" (ctrl+apple+s) and add "http://ping.blogug.ch" to Pings.



[1]: [ecto is 20% cheaper around christmas](http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/archives/001593.php), and IMHO an indispensable helper!
