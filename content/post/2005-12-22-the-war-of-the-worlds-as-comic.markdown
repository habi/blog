the [war of the worlds ecomic](http://www.darkhorse.com/zones/wotw/wotw_popup.php) has been loitering around in my netnewswire-tabs [1] for some months now. every now and then, the [darkhorse](http://www.darkhorse.com)-team has been releasing a few new pages of their adaptation of the [novel by h. g. wells](http://books.google.com/books?q=war+of+the+worlds&btnG=Search+Books&hl=en).
  
if you also dig comics a lot, then you might give it a go.
