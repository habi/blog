as you've maybe already seen in my [flick-stream](http://flickr.com/photos/habi/sets/72157600083031589/), i've been playing frisbee over the past weekend. we've made a team from [unisport bern](http://www.sport.unibe.ch/) [1] to compete against other in the [first university ultimate tournament](http://mooncatchers.free.fr/ulb/index.html) in bruxelles, belgium. it was a blast, the weather was marvellous, although a tad too hot, the other teams were competitive and we had great games. unfortunately i had to leave a bit earlier, so i was not able to play the finals (and that's why bern lost the final i think :-) and had quite a hard time until i got home, since the [train](http://www.thalys.com/) broke down about half an hour after departure from bruxelles, so it took me a night in the ICE to get back home to switzerland, but the whole weekend was worth it.

the image below was shot in the train toward bruxelles, and is composed of 8 images i took [standing on the armrest of tom's chair](http://www.flickr.com/photos/annaaaaaaaa/464911135/), stitched together with [hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/). if you'd like to see a quicktimeVR-file of the image below, you can click [here](http://habi.gna.ch/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/belgien-zug.mov) (.mov-file, 588kb).
