i finally found a free minute to sift through my pile of images, and was able to upload a first batch of images from the ecmc in basel.
  
you can see them [here](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/ecmc05/).
  
if you'd like to see more messengers messing around, then you can see [mathieus images](http://www.velocite.ch/images/ecmc/ecmc.html) (from lausanne) or some more in the [images-section](http://www.fahrradkurier.ch/bilder/run.html) of [fahrradkurier.ch](http://www.fahrradkurier.ch/bilder/run.html).
  
i'm still struggling with a panorama around the sharp turn of the uphill-sprint (the one [here](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/ecmc05/Pages/DSC01230.html)). maybe my g4 has not enough ram to handle a panorama consisting of 15 5 mpixel images. i'm trying it soon with resized images and keep you updated.
