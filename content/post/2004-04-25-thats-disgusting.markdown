[this survey](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/surveys/disgust/) by [the auntie's](http://www.bbc.co.uk/) science department is really interesting.
take it to the end and see how you score with your disgust threshold against other people or the prediction of the science-team. the whole survey took me less than 4 minutes to fill out and in the end the results and descriptions of 'em are really interesting. well worth those minutes!
