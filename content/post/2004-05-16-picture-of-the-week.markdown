yesterday, urs, simu and me went to winterthur, because the guys from [staffel x](http://www.staffelx.ch/) made an [alleycat](http://www.fahrradkurier.ch/aktuell/alley150504.jpg).
this is what it looks like if you cram three guys with their bikes and baggage in a [twingo](http://images.google.ch/images?hl=de&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=renault+twingo&btnG=Suche):

oh, and by the way, i've won that alleycat. pity for me that i didn't go to [the last alleycat in basel](http://www.fahrradkurier.ch/bilder/metropening.html), because there i could have won a bikeframe, this time the winner got a cap (not even from the staffel x, but from [veloexpress](http://veloexpress.ch/)) and a beer (and i don't like beer, so i could change that to a bottle of coke) :-(
