i just nearly broke my neck.
when i sat on my [panton chair](http://www.designmuseum.org/httpd/design/img_popup.php?id=13&img=5&imgStr=1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-) (a [verner panton](http://www.designmuseum.org/designerex/verner-panton.htm) original from 1972) it cracked half through and now looks like this:
[![DSC00888](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC00888-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC00888.JPG)  [![DSC00887](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC00887-tm.jpg)](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/images/DSC00887.JPG)  

the saddest part is, that the chair was a birthday present from my parents and is the most expensive piece of furniture i own (besides my selfmade sideboard/shelf which you can see in the background of the pictures).
now i have to decide if i want to shell out big cash to get a new old panton chair from [el trapero](http://el-trapero.ch/) or a new new cheaper chair from [vitra](http://www.vitra.com/products/seating/panton/panton_classic/default.asp?lang=il_en). if you've been at the [expo](http://www.expo.02.ch) in neuchatel you know them, a horrible tupperware-like polypropylene, not the heavy haptically interesting polyurethane. 
guess who is soon paying an unreasonable high amount of cash for a simple chair :-)
