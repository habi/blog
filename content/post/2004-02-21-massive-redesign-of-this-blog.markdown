because i had no plans for tonight (except burning 25 cd's with the oberwald-hitparade) i started to fiddle around with the design of the blog and now it looks quite different.
it was the first time i actually looked at my [css-file](http://habi.gna.ch/blog/styles-site.css) (the original one came with my installation of [MT](http://movabletype.org/), the final one is now released under [my cc-license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/)) and started to fiddle around with it. 
i was quite surprised that it's so easy to change the design of the page completely!

in addition i deleted the calendar in the sidebar. the calendar messed up the layout on windows-systems (thanks Ã¤bu) and i think no one will really miss it, because i want to incorporate some other [mean](http://www.nilesh.org/mt/blogtimes/) of showing my blog-habits (hint to b. :-)

and i also cleaned out some bugs in the sidebar code while leaving some others. for example i cannot seem to get rid of those 40 or 50 pixels above the "me" on the top left, and just couldn't make a line on the right side of the sidebar between the bar itself and the blog entries. 
leave a comment if you find some bugs on your system or can help me with the two issues mentioned above!

**update**. the annoying 30-pixel-break is gone, it was just a simple misplacement of margin-top:30px vs. margin-bottom:30px (thanks [arni](http://arnoldseefeld.com/blog/)!)
