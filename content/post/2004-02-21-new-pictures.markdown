the pictures of my last week in oberwald are [online](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/Oberwald/) in the [pictures-section](http://habi.gna.ch/pics/). 
it's quite a bunch of pictures, because i wanted to get a picture of nearly everyone of the class online.
enjoy them and have a nice saturday, i'll be [here](http://www.ruettihubelbad.ch/gaertnerei/gaertnerei_set.html) for the afternoon (it's an exhibition in the old people's home where my grand-mother lives)

**update**: the sensorium was really nice. 
even if don't have a grand-mother that lives in the [r√ºttihubelbad](http://www.ruettihubelbad.ch/stiftung_frameset.html) it's worth a visit (especially on a bad-weather-day). you can learn how to cast colorful shadows and do much more interesting stuff with all your senses!
